And in his growth stock funds, there are no driverless-car companies or hypersonic-missile manufacturers. Instead, you will find lots of industries with a decidedly 20th-century feel: oil, tobacco, banking. This formula has proven spectacularly successful. In less than seven years, Jain, the former chief investment officer at Vontobel Asset Management, has built GQG into a $92 billion powerhouse. Few, if any, startup funds in recent memory have raised so much money in so little time, according to Morningstar Direct. In 2022, when most asset managers watched clients yank cash from their funds as markets cratered, GQG thrived. The firm lured $8 billion in fresh investment and three of its four flagship funds beat benchmark indexes by wide margins. Pull the lens back further and the outperformance of GQG\u2019s biggest fund, the $26 billion Goldman Sachs GQG Partners International Opportunities Fund, is even starker. Since its inception in December 2016, the fund has gained 10.8% a year, more than double the benchmark\u2019s 3.9% annual return.  All this success, dating back to his days as a star manager at Vontobel, has given Jain a certain swagger. He plunks down huge sums of money on individual stocks and, in a heartbeat, can bail on an entire position \u2014 the sort of bold moves most in the industry avoid. Moreover, in talking with him, it quickly becomes clear that he doesn\u2019t make much of his rival stock-pickers. Jain considers himself a \u201cquality growth manager.\u201d He refers to others, without naming names, as \u201cquote-unquote quality growth managers.\u201d To him, many of them are mere imposters who rode the wave of cheap money, only to be exposed when the era of zero interest rates came to an abrupt end. \u201cThese kinds of volatile years actually allow you to differentiate a little bit more,\u201d he says in a telephone interview from GQG\u2019s headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \u201cA lot of \u2018quality growth\u2019 managers basically blew up. We found out whether they really own quality.\u201d Jain has had his share of missteps, of course. His big bet on Russia \u2014 16% of all his emerging-market fund\u2019s money was invested in the country at the start of 2022 \u2014 backfired badly when President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. He started to pull back as the war clouds began to gather but didn\u2019t liquidate all the fund\u2019s holdings and, as a result, it tumbled 21% last year, making it the only major GQG fund to underperform its benchmark. And this year, as US tech stocks rebounded on speculation the Federal Reserve was close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, GQG funds have trailed. His decision to underweight China has also been costly as the government lifted strict Covid lockdowns that were hamstringing the economy. Jain\u2019s international fund \u2014 which is distributed to investors by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u2014 has gained just 3.4% this year, compared with the benchmark\u2019s 7.8% jump, putting it in the bottom 6 percentile. \u201cI\u2019m not a happy camper these days,\u201d Jain says with a chuckle. Calculated Risks At some level, this year\u2019s underperformance isn\u2019t terribly surprising. The stocks Jain likes to own tend to be more defensive in nature, the kind that will hold up well in a downturn but lag when the economy and stock market are ripping. \u201cHe is so much more cautious than other growth managers,\u201d says Gregg\u202fWolper, a senior analyst at Morningstar. There is a seeming contradiction to it all, at least to an outside observer. Jain likes safe, defensive stocks but then makes outsize, risky bets on them. He explains the philosophy this way: By loading up on companies that have what he calls bullet-proof balance sheets \u2014 names like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Visa Inc. \u2014 it\u2019s unlikely any of them will suffer the kind of sudden collapse that\u2019d wreak havoc on his portfolio. \u201cWe try to take less absolute risk,\u201d Jain says. \u201cThe businesses we own generate lot of free cash flow. So the risk of us losing on an absolute basis is a lot lower. But sometimes that means you have to take more relative risk.\u201d Jain typically invests in 40 to 50 large-cap stocks in his international fund, compared with the benchmark\u2019s more than 2,000 companies. His US fund holds less than 30 stocks, compared with over 500 in the S&P index. Two of the international fund\u2019s top 10 holdings are tobacco companies \u2014 British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International. They account for almost 10% of the portfolio. Vontobel Years Born and raised in India, Jain moved to the US in 1990 to pursue his MBA at the University of Miami. He joined Vontobel in 1994, rising through the ranks to become the Swiss firm\u2019s CIO in 2002. By the time he left the firm to start GQG in March 2016, Vontobel\u2019s emerging market fund returned a total of 70% in 10 years, more than double the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Jain, who has a majority stake in GQG, invests most of his personal wealth in its funds. When GQG went public in Australia in 2021, raising about $893 million in the country\u2019s largest IPO that year, Jain pledged to invest 95% of the IPO proceeds in the company and keep the money there for seven years. There are other things that make Jain different than the typical boss at an investment firm: He refuses to meet with executives who run companies he\u2019s considering investing in so he doesn\u2019t \u201cdrink their Kool-Aid\u201d; he bans GQG employees from trading stocks in their personal accounts; and when his Russia bet went awry last year, he apologized on a conference call to GQG investors for the losses they took. \u201cHe has a combination of confidence and yet some humility in understanding that he might be wrong about something,\u201d says Wolper. \u2018Game of Survival\u2019 This ability to recognize errors \u2014 and rapidly change course, as a result \u2014 is something Jain believes his rivals lack. For instance, they failed, he says, to recognize last year that the tech-stock boom was about to go bust. He started cutting his tech holdings in late 2021 after riding the pandemic-fueled tech surge \u2014 or \u201cthe bubble,\u201d as he calls it \u2014 for a while. By March of last year, as inflation was percolating and interest rates were soaring, Jain had slashed his international fund\u2019s tech holdings all the way down to 5% of the portfolio from 23% in mid-2021, while increasing its weighting of energy stocks to 19% from less than 2%. That switch paid off handsomely, helping limit the fund\u2019s losses, as global energy stocks jumped 41% last year while tech stocks plunged 31%. \u201cInvesting is a game of survival because most people won\u2019t survive in the long run,\u201d says Jain. \u201cSo that should be the mindset rather than trying to win all the time. It\u2019s as much about avoiding losing rather than trying to win.\u201d And what if he\u2019s wrong now? What if the recent gains in tech are just the beginning of a broader rebound in the industry? Jain is dubious. To him, the tech giants shouldn\u2019t even be considered growth stocks anymore. But he\u2019s ready, he says, to blow up his portfolio once again if needed. \u201cIf the data proves that we are wrong, we are happy to change our mind.\u201d","1":"Taiwanese electronics giant, Foxconn will establish a manufacturing facility in Telangana which will create employment generation potential for over 1,00,000 people. A release from the Chief Minister's office said Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) and the state government have signed an agreement at Pragati Bhavan where Foxconn Chairman, Young Liu called on Rao. The 'historic deal' has potential to generate employment to over one lakh people over a period of 10 years, it noted. The CM said his \"government is on a mission to transform Telangana for better and has undertaken several marquee projects to realise the vision of Bangaru Telangana. Foxconn's unit will help in generating large scale employment to youth and will help attract more such industries to the state.\" Rao emphasized that Telangana considers Taiwan as a natural partner and that the state is glad to be a part of Foxconn's growth story. He called Foxconn's huge investment and the opportunity to create more than one lakh jobs like never before in Telangana 'commendable.' The Chief Minister further said steps will be taken to ensure that one lakh jobs are available to the state's youth and assured Young Liu that his government will provide necessary support to Foxconn for its operations in the state. The Foxconn Chairman lauded the friendly industrial development eco system created in Telangana and expressed happiness over the progress achieved by the state in the industrial sector, especially in IT and related electronics sectors, in just eight years. Rao hosted lunch for the Young Liu and his team. Later in the evening, Liu along with Telangana Minister KT Rama Rao inaugurated T Works a prototyping facility here. Speaking to reporters, Liu said his company is looking at sites and is currently evaluating the kind of products to be made in Telangana. The amount of investment depends on the products they plan to make.","2":"The historic market meltdown of Adani Group has shown signs of abating after the Indian conglomerate went on a\u00a0tour\u00a0to restore confidence and won a $1.9 billion investment by a boutique firm. But a closer look at billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s empire shows while fears of a debt blowup in the next three years have receded, investors still have doubts about the longer-term repayment abilities. The stock-market abyss that the ports-to-power conglomerate remains in and uncertainties over credit ratings continue to fan worries about its access to funds following a short seller attack. Such concerns have lingered on even after the Adani Group renewed efforts to appease investors during a three-day roadshow this week in Singapore and Hong Kong, where executives said the conglomerate has enough money to repay debt due over the next three years. A family trust\u00a0also sold\u00a0154.5 billion rupees ($1.9 billion) of stock in four companies to GQG Partners, a US-based boutique firm. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly positive he\u2019s managing to sell some of his holdings and raise some cash,\u201d said Kamil Dimmich of North of South Capital. \u201cIf we can see that engine resume where he can access financial markets again, that could stabilize things,\u201d he said, referring to the billionaire. The Adani Group has also cut expenses and made early debt repayment to alleviate a rout that has erased $153 billion from its stocks since US-based Hindenburg Research\u2019s fraud allegations, which it has denied. The following indicators will likely prove key to money managers\u2019 decisions on the conglomerate, as its crisis of confidence continues to unfold. Bond Risk  While most of Adani Group\u2019s 15 dollar bonds are off their lows hit right after Hindenburg\u2019s Jan. 24 report, all but one are still in the red. The group\u2019s four notes due by the end of 2026 are trading between 84 cents to 94 cents on the dollar, down from 91 cents to 99 cents before the report, but still indicating relatively low-payment risk. It\u2019s a different picture for bonds with maturities further down the road. Seven of the group\u2019s 11 notes due in or after 2027 are trading below or near 70 cents on the dollar, a level that defines distress or severe concerns about timely payment. Stock Slump  After a rout that had erased almost two-thirds of their combined market value, the group\u2019s 10 stocks staged a collective rebound Wednesday for the first time since Hindenburg\u2019s report, led by a near 15% surge in flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. The latest gains have helped cut the conglomerate\u2019s market wipeout to about $140 billion from a peak of $153 billion. But, it\u2019s still early days. Adani Total Gas Ltd., Adani Transmission Ltd. and Adani Green Energy Ltd., which racked up the biggest losses, remain 70% to 80% lower from their Jan. 24 levels. Hindenburg said in its report that Adani\u2019s seven key namesake stocks had sky-high valuations and faced downside of 85%. Shaky Ratings  Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which\u00a0cut\u00a0its outlook for Adani Green and three other group firms to negative from stable last month, said that refinancing maturing debt, changes to capital-spending plans, and capital-raising efforts are key variables to watch. Further ratings actions could follow if the firms\u2019 ability to raise capital is significantly curtailed, there is a significant increase in borrowing costs or deterioration of fundamentals. Similarly, S&P Global Ratings also\u00a0downgraded\u00a0the Adani Group\u2019s outlook to negative in February. It said that Indian banks will likely charge higher risk premiums and become extra cautious in the aftermath of the crisis. Investment Calls Of the seven key companies, five have minuscule analyst coverage and even for the other two with more following, the brutal selloff appears to have made a limited impact on the brokerages\u2019 perceptions. Flagship Adani Enterprises., which is tracked by only two brokerages, is split between a buy and a hold recommendation, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd., the crown jewel and a component of India\u2019s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index, is the most followed and has in fact increased its tally of buy calls to 21 from 20 before the crisis. \u201cWhat is missing here, what nobody talked about, was these are phenomenal, irreplaceable assets,\u201d Rajiv Jain, chairman of GQG said. \u201cYou have to be greedy when people are fearful.\u201d But some aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cInvestors should still avoid these shares since they are highly volatile,\u201d said Karthick Jonagadla, chief executive of Mumbai-based Quantace Research & Capital Pvt. \u201cIf any investor sold these shares a few weeks ago because of a whistleblower report and wants to buy now because they are cheap, such trades are mere speculation and lack fundamentals.\u201d ESG Retreat The crisis also has spilled over into the ESG market, prompting the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to\u00a0wipe\u00a0its relevant portfolios clean of exposure to the Adani empire. India\u2019s top court said Thursday it has\u00a0set up\u00a0a panel to probe allegations against Adani Group. It also asked the local markets regulator to investigate any manipulation in the group\u2019s stocks and inform about its findings within two months.","3":"GQG Partners Inc's Australian-listed shares fell by as much as 2.6% on Friday after the international investment firm pumped $1.87 billion into four companies under embattled Indian conglomerate Adani Group. The Florida-based firm bought 3.4% of Adani Enterprises Ltd for about $662 million, 4.1% of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd for $640 million, 2.5% of Adani Transmission Ltd for $230 million, and 3.5% of Adani Green Energy Ltd for $340 million, showed an Adani regulatory filing. In early trade, GQG shares were down by as much as 2.6% whereas the S&P\/ASX200 benchmark index was up 0.4%. GQG's move represents the first major investment in Adani Group since a short-seller's critical report of the conglomerate at the end of January triggered a stock rout.","4":"Sima Taparia, popularly known as Sima aunty, became a phenomenon after the airing of Netflix\u2019s latest docu-series Indian Matchmaking, in which she tries to bring together single men and women in marital bliss. Off-screen, Seema Yadav and Tarun Bansal, both employees of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), tied the knot in late February, whose union took place through a matrimonial service recently launched by the country\u2019s largest oil marketing company. Among the many congratulatory messages they received on social media was one shared by IOC Chairman and Managing Director Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, who wrote in a tweet: \u201cI was absolutely thrilled to witness the joyous union of Tarun and Seema, the first Indian Oil couple to find love through our very own 'IOCians2gether' platform that aims to create work & life partnerships within IndianOil!\u201d Wishing you a lifetime of happiness! pic.twitter.com\/LINOvRiz7C \u2014 ChairmanIOC (@ChairmanIOCL) February 24, 2023 Some social media users alleged that the couple had already been planning to get married and their wedding was used to promote the matrimonial service. Moneycontrol could not confirm this. What\u2019s clear is that IOC is keen to play Cupid for its employees as a part of its personnel retention policy. \u201cThe goal is to create work and life partnerships (for employees) and stay bonded with IndianOil. I am confident that IOCian-2gether will provide a vital resource for support and happiness for our employees,\u201d said Vaidya. The platform has been developed in-house and aims to offer a safe and supportive environment for employees to build fulfilling relationships while pursuing excellence in their personal and professional lives. \u201cLike the wide range of welfare initiatives rolled out by the Company, IOCian-2gether is an endeavour that aims to enhance employee wellness and resonates with IndianOil's Core Value of Care. As a company that prides itself as a family that nurtures strong bonds, this is yet another step towards cementing the bonds of the employees with the Company,\u201d Indian Oil said in a statement to Moneycontrol. Energy and infrastructure companies have faced challenges in attracting talent and retaining it, especially on project sites. Top executives have often complained about how challenging it is to get engineers to work at far-off sites that do not offer the lifestyle of cities and may require them to stay away from their families. Many drift away from the sector to jobs in information technology and other businesses, forcing management to work on strategies to retain talent. Indian Oil said that to use the website, unmarried employees of the company would have to post their profiles on the platform and can connect with other individuals who have also registered. \u201cThe employees can connect to profiles they find interesting and like-minded and mutually take the relationship forward. The portal operates on a voluntary registration basis, allowing individuals to create and manage their profiles according to their preferences and interests,\u201d the company said. The website has a strict privacy policy and ensures the confidentiality of its users' data, the company added. The portal is managed by Indian Oil\u2019s Information Systems team. While the service itself is not very different from other matrimonial services, what sets it apart is that it aims to do matchmaking only within the pool of Indian Oil employees. But energy companies have a long way to go to ensure diversity across teams. Are there enough women in Indian Oil to ensure the initiative succeeds? The state-owned company said it does. \u201cIndian Oil has a significant number of women employees working across the length and breadth of the country as well as across hierarchies, from the ground-level teams to the boardrooms. The platform will also extend important support to the growing number of women employees in Indian Oil who are powering the Company's operations even at the country's remotest corners,\u201d it said in the statement to Moneycontrol.","5":"Honda Cars India on March 2 launched two variants of its popular selling sedan - the new City (Petrol) and new City e:HEV - in the Indian market with sporty exterior styling, elegant interior enhancements and the introduction of new features for advanced safety, connectivity and convenience.

The City e:HEV, which already comes with Honda Sensing, will have an additional feature of \u201cLow-Speed Follow\u201d in the adaptive cruise control function that helps to maintain a safe distance from the preceding vehicle while driving at low speeds\/stop-and-go traffic. Another new feature \u2018Lead Car Departure Notification System\u2019 has been added to the Honda Sensing suite of safety features in both City (petrol) and City e:HEV that informs the driver with visual and audible alerts when the preceding vehicle starts moving in situations like Traffic Lights junctions.

SBI, India's largest bank, does not want to permanently retain a stake in Yes Bank and would want to trim its holdings, albeit in phases, one of the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. \"The percentage of equity dilution that the bank intends to do will have to be placed before the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) in due course.\" SBI held a 26.14% stake in Yes Bank as of December 31, stock exchange data showed, and is the largest single shareholder in the rescued lender.","7":"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday\u00a0 allowed\u00a0a petition filed by lenders of Reliance Capital seeking another round of auction for the debt-ridden firm undergoing insolvency process. A two-member bench set aside an order passed by NCLT and said the Committee of Creditors (CoC) has the power to negotiate and call for a higher bid. The appellate tribunal permitted the CoC to continue with the challenge mechanism and invite bids after two weeks. The NCLAT order came on a petition filed by Vistra ITCL (India), one of the lenders of Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital, challenging an order of NCLT which restricted further auction of the bankrupt firm. In the Reliance Capital (RCap) matter, Torrent Investments had emerged as the highest bidder with a resolution plan of Rs 8,640 crore. This was challenged by Torrent Investments before the Mumbai bench of NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal). The NCLT had on February 2 said the challenge mechanism for financial bids stood concluded as on December 21, 2022, with the bid of Torrent Investments at Rs 8,640 crore being the highest. Torrent Investments had filed a plea on January 9, requesting the tribunal to quash the lenders' plan to hold a fresh auction for takeover of RCap. Later, IIHL also filed a petition challenging the NCLT order. Torrent Investments was the highest bidder offering Rs 8,640 crore in the last round of the '' challenge mechanism''. IIHL has also challenged the NCLT order before the appellate tribunal.

The firm was founded in October by former Bank of Singapore market head for Global South Asia and the Middle East Hemant Tucker, Maitri Asset Management\u2019s ex-Chief Executive Officer Manish Tibrewal and three others. Much of the current client base is of Indian origin, and the rest come from a variety of backgrounds from Europe to other parts of Asia, Tucker said. Farro\u2019s rapid accumulation of assets underscores Singapore\u2019s continuing appeal to the super rich, despite recent efforts to raise\u00a0wealth taxes\u00a0and introduce stricter conditions for tax breaks. While it\u2019s gained recognition in recent years for an\u00a0influx of wealthy Chinese families, the city\u2019s low levies and relative stability are attracting a menagerie of global tycoons. \u201cWe are targeting families across the region from Japan to the UK and the US \u2014 whoever wants to have access to Asia with Singapore as a center,\u201d Tibrewal said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at adding another 50 families in the next 18 to 24 months,\u201d with an average AUM contribution of $30 million each, he said. More than 700 family offices \u2014 organizations that manage the lives and affairs of the super rich \u2014 were based in Singapore at the end of 2021, according to official estimates. More have set up there since, despite the imposition of\u00a0tighter rules\u00a0last April. Asia\u2019s richest man\u00a0Mukesh Ambani\u00a0opened a family office in the city-state last year, joining\u00a0Google co-founder Sergey Brin, hedge fund\u00a0billionaire Ray Dalio\u00a0and vacuum cleaning\u00a0entrepreneur James Dyson\u00a0among others. Farro\u2019s base in downtown Singapore is a simple office with a single boardroom, far from the glitzy, art-filled lobbies of many peers. It aims to have 20 staff by the end of the year who are able to do everything from arranging home loans to making portfolios ESG compliant, negotiating bank fees and sourcing deals. Its own fees vary depending on the level of work required. One of its key targets are family offices whose assets are big enough to have a handful of dedicated professionals but too small to warrant hiring a full-service team. Farro aims to fill the gaps, providing anything from investment opportunities to arranging trusts. One of its co-founders is Mahesh Kumar, who worked at law firm Withers KhattarWong helping private clients on their tax strategies. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more first-generation entrepreneurs than ever before and I would say that\u2019s more prevalent in a place like India,\u201d said Nirbhay Handa, head of private clients in Asia at Henley & Partners, which helps wealthy customers set up residency and investments around the world. \u201cWhen wealth increases, generally you see an uptick of a lot of families looking at a place like Singapore to set up their wealth structuring outfits.\u201d Handa said interest among wealthy entrepreneurs of\u00a0Indian\u00a0origin to move assets or relocate to Singapore remains high, even though it hasn\u2019t increased at the same rate as that of Chinese peers.","10":"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s group is getting into genetic mapping, looking to make a health care trend led by\u00a0disruptive US startups\u00a0like 23andMe more affordable and widespread in India\u2019s growing consumer market. The energy-to-ecommerce conglomerate will roll out within weeks a comprehensive 12,000-rupee ($145) genome sequencing test, according to Ramesh Hariharan, chief executive officer of Strand Life Sciences Pvt., which has developed the product. Reliance Industries Ltd., led by Asia\u2019s richest person, acquired the Bengaluru-based firm in 2021 and now owns about 80% of it. The genome test, which is about 86% cheaper than other offerings available locally, can reveal a person\u2019s predisposition to cancers, cardiac and neuro-degenerative ailments as well as identify inherited genetic disorders, he said. The project to bring affordable personal gene-mapping to India\u2019s 1.4 billion people \u2014 on track to be the world\u2019s most populous nation \u2014 will potentially create a treasure trove of biological data that can aid drug development and disease prevention in the region. It also dovetails with Ambani\u2019s ambitions to\u00a0dive further\u00a0into the world of data \u2014 he has often called it the \u201cnew oil\u201d \u2014 as he pivots his $192 billion empire beyond refining into consumer and digital services. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the cheapest such genomic profile in the world,\u201d Hariharan said, who also co-founded Strand Life Sciences. \u201cWe\u2019re going out at an aggressive price point to drive adoption as it gives us a chance to build a viable business in preventive health care.\u201d Health Red Flags While ancestry reports from 23andMe can be bought for $99, its health plus ancestry reports cost\u00a0$199. Full genome sequencing for health red flags costs more than\u00a0$1,000\u00a0from Indian rivals, MapmyGenome and\u00a0Medgenome. Cheapest offerings from some Chinese firms come for as low as 599 yuan ($87) but may not map the entire gamut of diseases that Reliance-owned Strand aims to detect. A representative for Reliance Industries did not respond to an emailed request for comments. Price disruption comes naturally to Ambani, who deployed a similar cut-throat strategy after it entered retail in 2006 and telecommunications in 2016, blowing out competition until Reliance emerged the market leader in both sectors. The global genetic testing market was valued at $12.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to touch $21.3 billion by 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from Allied Market Research. The new genome testing service \u201cwill ideally lead to creation of a big pool of data which will help development of targeted treatment and early intervention,\u201d said Vishal Manchanda, senior vice president at Systematix Institutional Equities, when told about Reliance\u2019s new product. But low prices alone may not be enough to lure people in a market like India where awareness of such services and their benefits are relatively untested. Though cheaper than global rivals, Reliance\u2019s $145 price tag is still a lot for the average consumer in India, where nearly two-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 a day. Aggressively Marketed Reliance\u2019s digital services and its recent e-commerce acquisitions can be deployed to push its genome testing product, which just needs blood samples that can be collected at home. Currently being piloted by a small number of early testers, it will be aggressively marketed by Reliance in the coming weeks on its MyJio app, with an outreach of 425 million wireless subscribers of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., health app JioHealthHub and the recently acquired e-pharmacy, Netmeds, Hariharan said. While a lot of consumer interest in the US has been around tracking ancestry or characteristics as such as athletic abilities, hair texture and propensity toward obesity \u2014 tests labeled \u2018recreational genetics\u2019 \u2014 the longer-term business model of these services centers around preventative health care. Genetic Link With more genomic data, global drugmakers could potentially develop new drugs as well as gain insight into how to better target existing therapies. This could be particularly useful in genetically under-mapped India, for example in helping prove a genetic link to certain over-represented diseases in the country. Still, these ambitions have yet to come to fruition anywhere, and early movers like 23andMe are now facing\u00a0regulatory pressure: the US Food and Drug Administration barred from the company from making any health-related claims in 2013 and put it through a two-year review process. In 2015, the regulator\u00a0allowed\u00a023AndMe to offer health-related testing. While Strand said it will incorporate latest scientific research in interpreting the test results, India has still not set regulatory standards for genetic tests. Also, it will be the company\u2019s first product in an inherently fast-changing and complicated scientific field. Hariharan said the new genome testing being rolled out by the Reliance group will \u201cset the standards\u201d for India. \u201cWe will offer responsible consumer genomics by staying close to the science.\u201d Disclaimer:\u00a0Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

He stated that they aim to add 150-175 screens annually for the next three years, with a focus on both Tier I and Tier II\/III cities. While 40 percent of the new screens will be located in Tier I cities, there are numerous opportunities to establish organized multiplexes in areas such as Hubli and Machilipatnam in southern India, where there are currently none. Bijli said that the next set of screen additions are coming from\u00a0the\u00a0INOX\u00a0stable with 14 screen launches in Pune\u00a0and Bengaluru each, and another 12 screens in Bengaluru. \"These are the 3-4 big superplexes planned in the coming year,\" he added. After the merger,\u00a0PVR INOX launched first property in Lucknow's Lulu Mall which is an 11-screen superplex. The company invested Rs 40 crore in the new property. \"We have three operating sites with them (Lulu Group) in Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Lucknow. We are hoping to continue this partnership. Lot of developments are being discussed but nothing concrete yet,\" said Bijli. Along with screen expansion, the merged entity expects\u00a0uptick in ad revenues. \"As a merged entity seeing more interest from advertisers. The merged entity will have a combined footfall of almost 180 million people a year across the chain and this number will be visible to brands and advertisers,\" the\u00a0Executive Director said. He added that while\u00a0the how much the merged entity can attract footfalls is yet to be assessed, he is confident about the industry at large. \"There's been dip in footfalls but we were open only for 11 months and had a clear run only since February last year. And footfalls are only 20-25\u00a0percent lower versus pre-Covid level. Yet we have big green shoots like Pathaan, Brahmastra, PS-I, RRR.\" He said that\u00a0things are recalibrating. \"Hollywood studios have already recalibrated their strategy. Two tears back Disney\u00a0had\u00a0decided to put\u00a0six movies directly on streaming but that did not turn out profitable and then they decided to bring all films on theatrical. It was the same with Warner Bros, Paramount. There was a time when they did not have an option but now people are saying that this is one revenue stream we cannot\u00a0ignore.\" Bijli said that both footfalls and advertising revenue will go back to pre-Covid levels in FY24. \"Since November with Drishyam 2 to Avatar 2 in December and Pathaan in January, every month there has been a big film which has done exceedingly well. The appetite of watching movies is there. There is some tweaking of content needed from film industry's side.\"","12":"Dan Rosensweig, President and CEO of Chegg, is joining Asia\u2019s Edtech stalwart upGrad\u2019s Board of Directors as an Independent Non-Executive Director. \u201cI am excited to be joining upGrad\u2019s Board of Directors as there has never been a better time to provide accessible and flexible higher education and skills training to learners around the world.

The credit line from the sovereign wealth fund could be upsized to $5 billion, said the two sources, citing a memo that was circulated to participants as highlights of a three-day investor roadshow ending on Wednesday. The identity of the sovereign wealth fund was not disclosed in the memo. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. A spokesperson for Adani did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The news of a fresh fundraising plan comes a day after Adani management told bondholders that it expected to prepay or repay\u00a0share-backed loans\u00a0worth $690 million to $790 million by end-March. The plans are being unveiled as the group holds a fixed-income roadshow this week in Singapore and Hong Kong to shore up investor confidence amid steep share price falls and a regulatory probe.

The project is spread across an area of 2.44 acres. It will house 239 apartments inside Embassy Spring township, which is approximately 288 acres. The 1 BHK, 2 BHK, and 3 BHK units are priced between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 1.48 crore. Mohit Nirula, CEO, Columbia Pacific Communities, said that the maintenance charges for each family will be about Rs 12,500 per month. The launch is scheduled for December 2026 and was announced at a press conference, led by Mohit Nirula, CEO, Columbia Pacific Communities, and Aditya Virwani, Chief Operating Officer, Embassy Group. \"We wanted a specialist partner who would provide an enriching experience for our seniors. In CPC, we found the ideal collaborator. Embassy Group\u2019s brand promise has been to deliver high-quality, future-first, and enhanced living spaces to all age groups -- from co-living for millennials to branded and luxury homes, and now we foray into\u00a0senior living,\" commented Aditya Virwani COO, Embassy Group. While this is CPC's 11th project, the Embassy Group is foraying into the senior living segment for the first time. \"With the Embassy Group, we are confident that this community will not only provide a healthy and comfortable space for senior residents but will also help them lead a blissful life,\" Nirula, CEO, Columbia Pacific Communities, added. Additional asset class, rentals Speaking at the event, Virwani said the senior living market, after COVID, has turned into a profitable venture. \"Senior living in India holds a 1 percent market share of the total real estate. In the US, we have a market share of 15 percent and 6-7 percent in Australia. Looking at the land bank we hold, we have a large share in integrated townships, including offices and residential spaces, and we see\u00a0senior living\u00a0as an additional asset class,\" he added. According to data from property consultants ANAROCK, as of 2021-end, there were as many as 57 senior living projects (developed or ongoing) across the country by the top 12 players, while the number of seniors has been exponentially increasing in India every year. Virwani said the mismatch in the senior living market today is attracting Embassy Group to foray into the sector. Nirula said that in the joint development for Serene Amara, the Embassy Group will be responsible for the\u00a0development\u00a0while CPC will focus on technology-driven services to seniors. He clarified that rentals will be only available for people who will own a property in Amara, opening doors to investment opportunities. \"We have just welcomed the first residents at The Virtuoso - The Columbia Pacific, a premium senior living project in Bengaluru. The appreciation in real- estate values from the time of launch till today is close to 50 percent,\" Nirula said. Virwani told\u00a0Moneycontrol\u00a0that the Embassy Group is mulling Phase 2 of Serene Amara -- a more premium senior living space in the luxury segment. \"We plan for more projects in southern India, especially in Bengaluru. On a short-term basis, we are looking at five such projects across the country and we hope the 1 percent market share will grow,\" he added. Nirula said, for CPC, the company plans to add 4-5 projects every year with a total investment of about Rs 800-1,000 crore in cities where the company is functional.","17":"De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd., a leading manufacturer of turboprop planes, is aiming to win 80% of India\u2019s small-plane market as the country seeks to bolster connectivity in far-flung corners and over rugged terrain. The company is expecting India to have as many as 120 small aircraft that seat less than 20 passengers in the next 10 years,\u00a0Yogesh Garg, the manufacturer\u2019s Asia Pacific sales director, said in an interview in New Delhi on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Airline Economics Growth Frontiers India conference. Small planes are key for India, the world\u2019s fastest-growing aviation market, to connect tiny towns, hilly areas and islands that have a budding population of first-time flyers. Airbus SE estimates India will need 2,210 aircraft by 2040, with most of them being smaller jets. De Havilland will face competition from the 19-seater\u00a0Dornier 228\u00a0aircraft. The Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. made-in-India plane is used by the armed forces, while\u00a0Alliance Air\u00a0has one. Another rival is Textron Aviation Inc., with regional carrier\u00a0IndiaOne Air\u00a0using its nine-seater\u00a0Cessna Grand Caravan EX. Better access to regional travel could help revive tourism and air traffic in India after the pandemic gutted travel. The government has allocated\u00a045 billion rupees\u00a0($544 million) under a regional connectivity program to develop 100 inadequately served airports, heliports and water aerodromes, in addition to opening 1,000 new routes by next year. It is also giving\u00a0subsidies\u00a0to airlines to offer passengers cheaper fares on regional routes. Budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd. is in discussions with De Havilland for five\u00a0Twin Otter\u00a0seaplanes, typically found in the Maldives shuttling tourists to resorts. SpiceJet could deploy the seaplanes, carrying 19 passengers, to reach remote parts of the country lacking runways and ground transport like Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Garg said. SpiceJet, De Havilland\u2019s top customer in India, currently operates 32\u00a0Dash-8 Q400\u00a0turboprop planes, which seat between 78 and 90 people, he said. IndiGo, India\u2019s biggest airline, has a fleet of\u00a078\u00a0ATR small planes, a joint venture between Airbus SE and Leonardo SpA of Italy. A spokesperson for SpiceJet didn\u2019t respond to a \u00a0request for comment. Regional carriers are also expanding their fleet of small planes.\u00a0FlyBig\u00a0has placed an order for 10 Twin Otter aircraft, with the first two potentially being delivered by April, Garg said. Gujarat\u2019s aviation infrastructure\u00a0agency\u00a0could add amphibious Twin Otters by the end of this year for routes such as the Sabarmati riverfront to the\u00a0Rann of Kuchchh, a salt marsh popular among tourists in the western Indian state.","18":"A Singapore-based money manager plans to raise as much as $125 million to supply energy efficient stoves to families in India and Africa, and will generate returns for investors by selling carbon credits. The Improved Cook Stoves Carbon Fund will be managed by Singapore\u2019s Impact Capital Asset Management, which has partnered with EKI Energy Services Ltd. The Indore, India-based EKI will invest $25 million in the fund and will also make the stoves, according to ICAM Chief Investment officer Deepak Mawandia. \u201cThere is a huge opportunity for a meaningful impact in India because if you look at the numbers, it\u2019s mind-boggling,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIn Africa, the impact on society is much larger, because in some of the areas that we are going and some of the things that we are doing, you see a lot more difference.\u201d The fund is betting the demand for carbon credits, which McKinsey & Co. forecasts may reach $50 billion by 2030, will help it generate returns for investors as polluting companies seek to balance their emissions with offsets generated by CO2-mitigating strategies. The proceeds will help the fund supply 3 million of the cookers in India, as well as Kenya and Ghana within about two years, Mawandia said. The stoves will still burn wood that\u2019s currently being used by families \u2014 thereby increasing uptake \u2014 but will provide better combustion, allowing households to use 50% less fuel and reduce toxic smoke by as much as 40%, according to ICAM. Each stove helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as five tons per year and the project will generate as much as 3 million carbon credits annually over five years for each $25 million disbursement, the fund said. \u201cIn the case of cook stoves, most clean alternatives are more expensive than traditional cookstoves,\u201d said Kyle Harrison, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cBut offsets can bridge the gap in costs to allow rapid deployment. We forecast carbon offset supply from clean cookstoves could reach 542 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2050.\u201d Most Vulnerable ICAM will deploy the stoves in phases. During each tranche, as many as 750,000 will be distributed free to people living in rural areas, specifically targeting those who use traditional methods of cooking, typically three-stone stoves which use coal, cowdung and, firewood as fuel. \u201cIt\u2019s an energy efficient project with a huge climate impact, and indirectly it has an impact on education, economic welfare, health, hygiene,\u201d Mawandia said. \u201cWe believe that a well constructed clean-cooking program is perhaps one of the most impactful projects in the climate change space.\u201d The first beneficiaries will be in India, the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases by volume in 2022. That will be followed by Kenya and Ghana in Africa, the continent that\u2019s most vulnerable to climate change, despite having contributed the least to global warming and having the lowest emissions. While EKI is the fund\u2019s first partner, it\u2019s also seeking to entice family offices in Singapore, as well as hedge funds, and European impact investors, Mawandia said.","19":"Akasa Air is going to place an order for a fleet of aircraft which will be in three digits by the year-end, the company has said.

The stable outlook reflects that AICTPL will maintain predictable cash flow with fully market-based pricing and volume over the next 12-24 months. AICTPL is a 50-50 joint venture between Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd and Terminal Investment Ltd (TIL). It works as a container terminal operator based in Mundra, Gujarat. It is at a prime location with favourable water depth compared with other nearby ports, besides broad rail and road connectivity to India's industrial hinterland. \"We affirmed our issue rating on AICTPL because we believe our revised criteria for project finance transactions does not impact our assessment of the project's creditworthiness,\" S&P Global Ratings said in a statement. Issuers and debt issues that receive a rating of 'BBB-' or above are generally considered by regulators and market participants to be 'investment-grade', according to S&P Global Ratings. S&P further said that it believes an upgrade is unlikely over the next 12-24 months, because the rating on AICTPL is constrained by its sovereign rating on India. \"In addition, we do not expect the SACP (standalone credit profile) to improve, given the overall financial metrics are constrained by the large balloon payment,\" it said.","24":"Packaging solutions provider Uflex on Wednesday claimed that the\u00a0Income Tax Department has \"not seized anything incriminating\" from the company in the raid conducted for seven consecutive days. The company in a regulatory filing has also \"vehemently\" denied media reports alleging bogus transactions undertaken by it, seizure of evidence, irregularities running in thousands of crores and huge unaccounted income. \"We hereby state that pursuant to the searches carried on by the Income Tax dept w.r.t Uflex...from Feb 21 to Feb 27,\u00a0 2023, all stocks of raw materials, finished goods, work in process and other assets were found to be duly recorded and all books of accounts were found to be in order,\" it said. Uflex further said : \"The search team has not seized anything incriminating. The company adheres to good business practices.\" The I-T department is yet to come up with a statement over the seizure during the raids on Uflex offices. On the media reports, Uflex said it can be best described as \"frivolous and baseless\". \"It is relevant to add that even in the similar search carried out in the year 2014, media had gone on record to state huge discovery of huge unaccounted income at Uflex Limited, which was absolutely untrue and in the final reassessment by the I-T dept, nothing of such sort was found,\" it said. Uflex further said it\u00a0shall keep the public, investors and the authorities updated in the matter, as per the applicable provisions of SEBI. The I-T Department had on February 21 launched searches at multiple premises of the company across various states, including the Uflex head office in Noida, as part of a tax evasion investigation. Official sources said the raids have now ended and the taxmen have recovered a number of financial documents and digital hardware from the searched locations. Uflex is India's largest flexible packaging materials and solutions company and a leading global polymer sciences corporation. Founded in 1985, the company has a presence in multiple verticals of the packaging value chain - packaging films, chemicals, aseptic liquid packaging, holography, flexible packaging, printing cylinders and engineering."}}
