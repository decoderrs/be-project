0,2023-03-03 09:13:00,GQG Partners: How Rajiv Jain built a $92 billion stock empire,"This formula has proven spectacularly successful. In less than seven years, Jain, the former chief investment officer at Vontobel Asset Management, has built GQG into a $92 billion powerhouse. Few, if any, startup funds in recent memory have raised so much money in so little time, according to Morningstar Direct.","The co-founder of GQG Partners doesn’t have a Twitter account and rarely appears on TV. And in his growth stock funds, there are no driverless-car companies or hypersonic-missile manufacturers. Instead, you will find lots of industries with a decidedly 20th-century feel: oil, tobacco, banking. This formula has proven spectacularly successful. In less than seven years, Jain, the former chief investment officer at Vontobel Asset Management, has built GQG into a $92 billion powerhouse. Few, if any, startup funds in recent memory have raised so much money in so little time, according to Morningstar Direct. In 2022, when most asset managers watched clients yank cash from their funds as markets cratered, GQG thrived. The firm lured $8 billion in fresh investment and three of its four flagship funds beat benchmark indexes by wide margins. Pull the lens back further and the outperformance of GQG’s biggest fund, the $26 billion Goldman Sachs GQG Partners International Opportunities Fund, is even starker. Since its inception in December 2016, the fund has gained 10.8% a year, more than double the benchmark’s 3.9% annual return.  All this success, dating back to his days as a star manager at Vontobel, has given Jain a certain swagger. He plunks down huge sums of money on individual stocks and, in a heartbeat, can bail on an entire position — the sort of bold moves most in the industry avoid. Moreover, in talking with him, it quickly becomes clear that he doesn’t make much of his rival stock-pickers. Jain considers himself a “quality growth manager.” He refers to others, without naming names, as “quote-unquote quality growth managers.” To him, many of them are mere imposters who rode the wave of cheap money, only to be exposed when the era of zero interest rates came to an abrupt end. “These kinds of volatile years actually allow you to differentiate a little bit more,” he says in a telephone interview from GQG’s headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “A lot of ‘quality growth’ managers basically blew up. We found out whether they really own quality.” Jain has had his share of missteps, of course. His big bet on Russia — 16% of all his emerging-market fund’s money was invested in the country at the start of 2022 — backfired badly when President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. He started to pull back as the war clouds began to gather but didn’t liquidate all the fund’s holdings and, as a result, it tumbled 21% last year, making it the only major GQG fund to underperform its benchmark. And this year, as US tech stocks rebounded on speculation the Federal Reserve was close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, GQG funds have trailed. His decision to underweight China has also been costly as the government lifted strict Covid lockdowns that were hamstringing the economy. Jain’s international fund — which is distributed to investors by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. — has gained just 3.4% this year, compared with the benchmark’s 7.8% jump, putting it in the bottom 6 percentile. “I’m not a happy camper these days,” Jain says with a chuckle. Calculated Risks At some level, this year’s underperformance isn’t terribly surprising. The stocks Jain likes to own tend to be more defensive in nature, the kind that will hold up well in a downturn but lag when the economy and stock market are ripping. “He is so much more cautious than other growth managers,” says Gregg Wolper, a senior analyst at Morningstar. There is a seeming contradiction to it all, at least to an outside observer. Jain likes safe, defensive stocks but then makes outsize, risky bets on them. He explains the philosophy this way: By loading up on companies that have what he calls bullet-proof balance sheets — names like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Visa Inc. — it’s unlikely any of them will suffer the kind of sudden collapse that’d wreak havoc on his portfolio. “We try to take less absolute risk,” Jain says. “The businesses we own generate lot of free cash flow. So the risk of us losing on an absolute basis is a lot lower. But sometimes that means you have to take more relative risk.” Jain typically invests in 40 to 50 large-cap stocks in his international fund, compared with the benchmark’s more than 2,000 companies. His US fund holds less than 30 stocks, compared with over 500 in the S&P index. Two of the international fund’s top 10 holdings are tobacco companies — British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International. They account for almost 10% of the portfolio. Vontobel Years Born and raised in India, Jain moved to the US in 1990 to pursue his MBA at the University of Miami. He joined Vontobel in 1994, rising through the ranks to become the Swiss firm’s CIO in 2002. By the time he left the firm to start GQG in March 2016, Vontobel’s emerging market fund returned a total of 70% in 10 years, more than double the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Jain, who has a majority stake in GQG, invests most of his personal wealth in its funds. When GQG went public in Australia in 2021, raising about $893 million in the country’s largest IPO that year, Jain pledged to invest 95% of the IPO proceeds in the company and keep the money there for seven years. There are other things that make Jain different than the typical boss at an investment firm: He refuses to meet with executives who run companies he’s considering investing in so he doesn’t “drink their Kool-Aid”; he bans GQG employees from trading stocks in their personal accounts; and when his Russia bet went awry last year, he apologized on a conference call to GQG investors for the losses they took. “He has a combination of confidence and yet some humility in understanding that he might be wrong about something,” says Wolper. ‘Game of Survival’ This ability to recognize errors — and rapidly change course, as a result — is something Jain believes his rivals lack. For instance, they failed, he says, to recognize last year that the tech-stock boom was about to go bust. He started cutting his tech holdings in late 2021 after riding the pandemic-fueled tech surge — or “the bubble,” as he calls it — for a while. By March of last year, as inflation was percolating and interest rates were soaring, Jain had slashed his international fund’s tech holdings all the way down to 5% of the portfolio from 23% in mid-2021, while increasing its weighting of energy stocks to 19% from less than 2%. That switch paid off handsomely, helping limit the fund’s losses, as global energy stocks jumped 41% last year while tech stocks plunged 31%. “Investing is a game of survival because most people won’t survive in the long run,” says Jain. “So that should be the mindset rather than trying to win all the time. It’s as much about avoiding losing rather than trying to win.” And what if he’s wrong now? What if the recent gains in tech are just the beginning of a broader rebound in the industry? Jain is dubious. To him, the tech giants shouldn’t even be considered growth stocks anymore. But he’s ready, he says, to blow up his portfolio once again if needed. “If the data proves that we are wrong, we are happy to change our mind.”"

2,2023-03-03 07:14:00,Adani bonds still shaken even as $153 billion stock rout eases,The stock-market abyss that the ports-to-power conglomerate remains in and uncertainties over credit ratings continue to fan worries about its access to funds following a short seller attack. ,"The historic market meltdown of Adani Group has shown signs of abating after the Indian conglomerate went on a tour to restore confidence and won a $1.9 billion investment by a boutique firm. But a closer look at billionaire Gautam Adani’s empire shows while fears of a debt blowup in the next three years have receded, investors still have doubts about the longer-term repayment abilities. The stock-market abyss that the ports-to-power conglomerate remains in and uncertainties over credit ratings continue to fan worries about its access to funds following a short seller attack. Such concerns have lingered on even after the Adani Group renewed efforts to appease investors during a three-day roadshow this week in Singapore and Hong Kong, where executives said the conglomerate has enough money to repay debt due over the next three years. A family trust also sold 154.5 billion rupees ($1.9 billion) of stock in four companies to GQG Partners, a US-based boutique firm. “It’s certainly positive he’s managing to sell some of his holdings and raise some cash,” said Kamil Dimmich of North of South Capital. “If we can see that engine resume where he can access financial markets again, that could stabilize things,” he said, referring to the billionaire. The Adani Group has also cut expenses and made early debt repayment to alleviate a rout that has erased $153 billion from its stocks since US-based Hindenburg Research’s fraud allegations, which it has denied. The following indicators will likely prove key to money managers’ decisions on the conglomerate, as its crisis of confidence continues to unfold. Bond Risk  While most of Adani Group’s 15 dollar bonds are off their lows hit right after Hindenburg’s Jan. 24 report, all but one are still in the red. The group’s four notes due by the end of 2026 are trading between 84 cents to 94 cents on the dollar, down from 91 cents to 99 cents before the report, but still indicating relatively low-payment risk. It’s a different picture for bonds with maturities further down the road. Seven of the group’s 11 notes due in or after 2027 are trading below or near 70 cents on the dollar, a level that defines distress or severe concerns about timely payment. Stock Slump  After a rout that had erased almost two-thirds of their combined market value, the group’s 10 stocks staged a collective rebound Wednesday for the first time since Hindenburg’s report, led by a near 15% surge in flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. The latest gains have helped cut the conglomerate’s market wipeout to about $140 billion from a peak of $153 billion. But, it’s still early days. Adani Total Gas Ltd., Adani Transmission Ltd. and Adani Green Energy Ltd., which racked up the biggest losses, remain 70% to 80% lower from their Jan. 24 levels. Hindenburg said in its report that Adani’s seven key namesake stocks had sky-high valuations and faced downside of 85%. Shaky Ratings  Moody’s Investors Service, which cut its outlook for Adani Green and three other group firms to negative from stable last month, said that refinancing maturing debt, changes to capital-spending plans, and capital-raising efforts are key variables to watch. Further ratings actions could follow if the firms’ ability to raise capital is significantly curtailed, there is a significant increase in borrowing costs or deterioration of fundamentals. Similarly, S&P Global Ratings also downgraded the Adani Group’s outlook to negative in February. It said that Indian banks will likely charge higher risk premiums and become extra cautious in the aftermath of the crisis. Investment Calls Of the seven key companies, five have minuscule analyst coverage and even for the other two with more following, the brutal selloff appears to have made a limited impact on the brokerages’ perceptions. Flagship Adani Enterprises., which is tracked by only two brokerages, is split between a buy and a hold recommendation, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd., the crown jewel and a component of India’s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index, is the most followed and has in fact increased its tally of buy calls to 21 from 20 before the crisis. “What is missing here, what nobody talked about, was these are phenomenal, irreplaceable assets,” Rajiv Jain, chairman of GQG said. “You have to be greedy when people are fearful.” But some aren’t convinced. “Investors should still avoid these shares since they are highly volatile,” said Karthick Jonagadla, chief executive of Mumbai-based Quantace Research & Capital Pvt. “If any investor sold these shares a few weeks ago because of a whistleblower report and wants to buy now because they are cheap, such trades are mere speculation and lack fundamentals.” ESG Retreat The crisis also has spilled over into the ESG market, prompting the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to wipe its relevant portfolios clean of exposure to the Adani empire. India’s top court said Thursday it has set up a panel to probe allegations against Adani Group. It also asked the local markets regulator to investigate any manipulation in the group’s stocks and inform about its findings within two months."

In early trade, GQG shares were down by as much as 2.6% whereas the S&P/ASX200 benchmark index was up 0.4%.

","Sima Taparia, popularly known as Sima aunty, became a phenomenon after the airing of Netflix’s latest docu-series Indian Matchmaking, in which she tries to bring together single men and women in marital bliss. Off-screen, Seema Yadav and Tarun Bansal, both employees of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), tied the knot in late February, whose union took place through a matrimonial service recently launched by the country’s largest oil marketing company. Among the many congratulatory messages they received on social media was one shared by IOC Chairman and Managing Director Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, who wrote in a tweet: “I was absolutely thrilled to witness the joyous union of Tarun and Seema, the first Indian Oil couple to find love through our very own 'IOCians2gether' platform that aims to create work & life partnerships within IndianOil!” Wishing you a lifetime of happiness! pic.twitter.com/LINOvRiz7C — ChairmanIOC (@ChairmanIOCL) February 24, 2023 Some social media users alleged that the couple had already been planning to get married and their wedding was used to promote the matrimonial service. Moneycontrol could not confirm this. What’s clear is that IOC is keen to play Cupid for its employees as a part of its personnel retention policy. “The goal is to create work and life partnerships (for employees) and stay bonded with IndianOil. I am confident that IOCian-2gether will provide a vital resource for support and happiness for our employees,” said Vaidya. The platform has been developed in-house and aims to offer a safe and supportive environment for employees to build fulfilling relationships while pursuing excellence in their personal and professional lives. “Like the wide range of welfare initiatives rolled out by the Company, IOCian-2gether is an endeavour that aims to enhance employee wellness and resonates with IndianOil's Core Value of Care. As a company that prides itself as a family that nurtures strong bonds, this is yet another step towards cementing the bonds of the employees with the Company,” Indian Oil said in a statement to Moneycontrol. Energy and infrastructure companies have faced challenges in attracting talent and retaining it, especially on project sites. Top executives have often complained about how challenging it is to get engineers to work at far-off sites that do not offer the lifestyle of cities and may require them to stay away from their families. Many drift away from the sector to jobs in information technology and other businesses, forcing management to work on strategies to retain talent. Indian Oil said that to use the website, unmarried employees of the company would have to post their profiles on the platform and can connect with other individuals who have also registered. “The employees can connect to profiles they find interesting and like-minded and mutually take the relationship forward. The portal operates on a voluntary registration basis, allowing individuals to create and manage their profiles according to their preferences and interests,” the company said. The website has a strict privacy policy and ensures the confidentiality of its users' data, the company added. The portal is managed by Indian Oil’s Information Systems team. While the service itself is not very different from other matrimonial services, what sets it apart is that it aims to do matchmaking only within the pool of Indian Oil employees. But energy companies have a long way to go to ensure diversity across teams. Are there enough women in Indian Oil to ensure the initiative succeeds? The state-owned company said it does. “Indian Oil has a significant number of women employees working across the length and breadth of the country as well as across hierarchies, from the ground-level teams to the boardrooms. The platform will also extend important support to the growing number of women employees in Indian Oil who are powering the Company's operations even at the country's remotest corners,” it said in the statement to Moneycontrol."

A two-member bench set aside an order passed by NCLT and said the Committee of Creditors (CoC) has the power to negotiate and call for a higher bid. The appellate tribunal permitted the CoC to continue with the challenge mechanism and invite bids after two weeks. The NCLAT order came on a petition filed by Vistra ITCL (India), one of the lenders of Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital, challenging an order of NCLT which restricted further auction of the bankrupt firm.

9,2023-03-02 07:55:00,Super rich of Indian origin are top clients at new Singapore wealth firm,"The firm was founded in October by former Bank of Singapore market head for Global South Asia and the Middle East Hemant Tucker, Maitri Asset Management’s ex-Chief Executive Officer Manish Tibrewal and three others. ","Singapore-based multi-family office Farro Capital says it has amassed more than $1 billion in assets under management just four months after it launched, highlighting the city-state’s rise as a hub for wealthy clans. The firm was founded in October by former Bank of Singapore market head for Global South Asia and the Middle East Hemant Tucker, Maitri Asset Management’s ex-Chief Executive Officer Manish Tibrewal and three others. Much of the current client base is of Indian origin, and the rest come from a variety of backgrounds from Europe to other parts of Asia, Tucker said. Farro’s rapid accumulation of assets underscores Singapore’s continuing appeal to the super rich, despite recent efforts to raise wealth taxes and introduce stricter conditions for tax breaks. While it’s gained recognition in recent years for an influx of wealthy Chinese families, the city’s low levies and relative stability are attracting a menagerie of global tycoons. “We are targeting families across the region from Japan to the UK and the US — whoever wants to have access to Asia with Singapore as a center,” Tibrewal said. “We’re looking at adding another 50 families in the next 18 to 24 months,” with an average AUM contribution of $30 million each, he said. More than 700 family offices — organizations that manage the lives and affairs of the super rich — were based in Singapore at the end of 2021, according to official estimates. More have set up there since, despite the imposition of tighter rules last April. Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani opened a family office in the city-state last year, joining Google co-founder Sergey Brin, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio and vacuum cleaning entrepreneur James Dyson among others. Farro’s base in downtown Singapore is a simple office with a single boardroom, far from the glitzy, art-filled lobbies of many peers. It aims to have 20 staff by the end of the year who are able to do everything from arranging home loans to making portfolios ESG compliant, negotiating bank fees and sourcing deals. Its own fees vary depending on the level of work required. One of its key targets are family offices whose assets are big enough to have a handful of dedicated professionals but too small to warrant hiring a full-service team. Farro aims to fill the gaps, providing anything from investment opportunities to arranging trusts. One of its co-founders is Mahesh Kumar, who worked at law firm Withers KhattarWong helping private clients on their tax strategies. “We’re seeing more first-generation entrepreneurs than ever before and I would say that’s more prevalent in a place like India,” said Nirbhay Handa, head of private clients in Asia at Henley & Partners, which helps wealthy customers set up residency and investments around the world. “When wealth increases, generally you see an uptick of a lot of families looking at a place like Singapore to set up their wealth structuring outfits.” Handa said interest among wealthy entrepreneurs of Indian origin to move assets or relocate to Singapore remains high, even though it hasn’t increased at the same rate as that of Chinese peers."
10,2023-03-02 07:43:00,"Mukesh Ambani to foray into genome testing with Rs 12,000 kit","The genome test, which is about 86% cheaper than other offerings available locally, can reveal a person’s predisposition to cancers, cardiac and neuro-degenerative ailments as well as identify inherited genetic disorders, he said. ","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s group is getting into genetic mapping, looking to make a health care trend led by disruptive US startups like 23andMe more affordable and widespread in India’s growing consumer market. The energy-to-ecommerce conglomerate will roll out within weeks a comprehensive 12,000-rupee ($145) genome sequencing test, according to Ramesh Hariharan, chief executive officer of Strand Life Sciences Pvt., which has developed the product. Reliance Industries Ltd., led by Asia’s richest person, acquired the Bengaluru-based firm in 2021 and now owns about 80% of it. The genome test, which is about 86% cheaper than other offerings available locally, can reveal a person’s predisposition to cancers, cardiac and neuro-degenerative ailments as well as identify inherited genetic disorders, he said. The project to bring affordable personal gene-mapping to India’s 1.4 billion people — on track to be the world’s most populous nation — will potentially create a treasure trove of biological data that can aid drug development and disease prevention in the region. It also dovetails with Ambani’s ambitions to dive further into the world of data — he has often called it the “new oil” — as he pivots his $192 billion empire beyond refining into consumer and digital services. “It’ll be the cheapest such genomic profile in the world,” Hariharan said, who also co-founded Strand Life Sciences. “We’re going out at an aggressive price point to drive adoption as it gives us a chance to build a viable business in preventive health care.” Health Red Flags While ancestry reports from 23andMe can be bought for $99, its health plus ancestry reports cost $199. Full genome sequencing for health red flags costs more than $1,000 from Indian rivals, MapmyGenome and Medgenome. Cheapest offerings from some Chinese firms come for as low as 599 yuan ($87) but may not map the entire gamut of diseases that Reliance-owned Strand aims to detect. A representative for Reliance Industries did not respond to an emailed request for comments. Price disruption comes naturally to Ambani, who deployed a similar cut-throat strategy after it entered retail in 2006 and telecommunications in 2016, blowing out competition until Reliance emerged the market leader in both sectors. The global genetic testing market was valued at $12.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to touch $21.3 billion by 2027, according to a report from Allied Market Research. The new genome testing service “will ideally lead to creation of a big pool of data which will help development of targeted treatment and early intervention,” said Vishal Manchanda, senior vice president at Systematix Institutional Equities, when told about Reliance’s new product. But low prices alone may not be enough to lure people in a market like India where awareness of such services and their benefits are relatively untested. Though cheaper than global rivals, Reliance’s $145 price tag is still a lot for the average consumer in India, where nearly two-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 a day. Aggressively Marketed Reliance’s digital services and its recent e-commerce acquisitions can be deployed to push its genome testing product, which just needs blood samples that can be collected at home. Currently being piloted by a small number of early testers, it will be aggressively marketed by Reliance in the coming weeks on its MyJio app, with an outreach of 425 million wireless subscribers of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., health app JioHealthHub and the recently acquired e-pharmacy, Netmeds, Hariharan said. While a lot of consumer interest in the US has been around tracking ancestry or characteristics as such as athletic abilities, hair texture and propensity toward obesity — tests labeled ‘recreational genetics’ — the longer-term business model of these services centers around preventative health care. Genetic Link With more genomic data, global drugmakers could potentially develop new drugs as well as gain insight into how to better target existing therapies. This could be particularly useful in genetically under-mapped India, for example in helping prove a genetic link to certain over-represented diseases in the country. Still, these ambitions have yet to come to fruition anywhere, and early movers like 23andMe are now facing regulatory pressure: the US Food and Drug Administration barred from the company from making any health-related claims in 2013 and put it through a two-year review process. In 2015, the regulator allowed 23AndMe to offer health-related testing. While Strand said it will incorporate latest scientific research in interpreting the test results, India has still not set regulatory standards for genetic tests. Also, it will be the company’s first product in an inherently fast-changing and complicated scientific field. Hariharan said the new genome testing being rolled out by the Reliance group will “set the standards” for India. “We will offer responsible consumer genomics by staying close to the science.” Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

He stated that they aim to add 150-175 screens annually for the next three years, with a focus on both Tier I and Tier II/III cities. While 40 percent of the new screens will be located in Tier I cities, there are numerous opportunities to establish organized multiplexes in areas such as Hubli and Machilipatnam in southern India, where there are currently none. Bijli said that the next set of screen additions are coming from the INOX stable with 14 screen launches in Pune and Bengaluru each, and another 12 screens in Bengaluru. ""These are the 3-4 big superplexes planned in the coming year,"" he added. After the merger, PVR INOX launched first property in Lucknow's Lulu Mall which is an 11-screen superplex. The company invested Rs 40 crore in the new property. ""We have three operating sites with them (Lulu Group) in Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Lucknow. We are hoping to continue this partnership. Lot of developments are being discussed but nothing concrete yet,"" said Bijli. Along with screen expansion, the merged entity expects uptick in ad revenues. ""As a merged entity seeing more interest from advertisers. The merged entity will have a combined footfall of almost 180 million people a year across the chain and this number will be visible to brands and advertisers,"" the Executive Director said. He added that while the how much the merged entity can attract footfalls is yet to be assessed, he is confident about the industry at large. ""There's been dip in footfalls but we were open only for 11 months and had a clear run only since February last year. And footfalls are only 20-25 percent lower versus pre-Covid level. Yet we have big green shoots like Pathaan, Brahmastra, PS-I, RRR."" He said that things are recalibrating. ""Hollywood studios have already recalibrated their strategy. Two tears back Disney had decided to put six movies directly on streaming but that did not turn out profitable and then they decided to bring all films on theatrical. It was the same with Warner Bros, Paramount. There was a time when they did not have an option but now people are saying that this is one revenue stream we cannot ignore."" Bijli said that both footfalls and advertising revenue will go back to pre-Covid levels in FY24. ""Since November with Drishyam 2 to Avatar 2 in December and Pathaan in January, every month there has been a big film which has done exceedingly well. The appetite of watching movies is there. There is some tweaking of content needed from film industry's side."""

The project is spread across an area of 2.44 acres. It will house 239 apartments inside Embassy Spring township, which is approximately 288 acres. The 1 BHK, 2 BHK, and 3 BHK units are priced between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 1.48 crore. Mohit Nirula, CEO, Columbia Pacific Communities, said that the maintenance charges for each family will be about Rs 12,500 per month. The launch is scheduled for December 2026 and was announced at a press conference, led by Mohit Nirula, CEO, Columbia Pacific Communities, and Aditya Virwani, Chief Operating Officer, Embassy Group. ""We wanted a specialist partner who would provide an enriching experience for our seniors. In CPC, we found the ideal collaborator. Embassy Group’s brand promise has been to deliver high-quality, future-first, and enhanced living spaces to all age groups -- from co-living for millennials to branded and luxury homes, and now we foray into senior living,"" commented Aditya Virwani COO, Embassy Group. While this is CPC's 11th project, the Embassy Group is foraying into the senior living segment for the first time. ""With the Embassy Group, we are confident that this community will not only provide a healthy and comfortable space for senior residents but will also help them lead a blissful life,"" Nirula, CEO, Columbia Pacific Communities, added. Additional asset class, rentals Speaking at the event, Virwani said the senior living market, after COVID, has turned into a profitable venture. ""Senior living in India holds a 1 percent market share of the total real estate. In the US, we have a market share of 15 percent and 6-7 percent in Australia. Looking at the land bank we hold, we have a large share in integrated townships, including offices and residential spaces, and we see senior living as an additional asset class,"" he added. According to data from property consultants ANAROCK, as of 2021-end, there were as many as 57 senior living projects (developed or ongoing) across the country by the top 12 players, while the number of seniors has been exponentially increasing in India every year. Virwani said the mismatch in the senior living market today is attracting Embassy Group to foray into the sector. Nirula said that in the joint development for Serene Amara, the Embassy Group will be responsible for the development while CPC will focus on technology-driven services to seniors. He clarified that rentals will be only available for people who will own a property in Amara, opening doors to investment opportunities. ""We have just welcomed the first residents at The Virtuoso - The Columbia Pacific, a premium senior living project in Bengaluru. The appreciation in real- estate values from the time of launch till today is close to 50 percent,"" Nirula said. Virwani told Moneycontrol that the Embassy Group is mulling Phase 2 of Serene Amara -- a more premium senior living space in the luxury segment. ""We plan for more projects in southern India, especially in Bengaluru. On a short-term basis, we are looking at five such projects across the country and we hope the 1 percent market share will grow,"" he added. Nirula said, for CPC, the company plans to add 4-5 projects every year with a total investment of about Rs 800-1,000 crore in cities where the company is functional."
17,2023-03-01 02:22:00,De Havilland Sseks to dominate Indian demand for small planes,"The company is expecting India to have as many as 120 small aircraft that seat less than 20 passengers in the next 10 years, Yogesh Garg, the manufacturer’s Asia Pacific sales director, said in an interview in New Delhi on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Airline Economics Growth Frontiers India conference. ","De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd., a leading manufacturer of turboprop planes, is aiming to win 80% of India’s small-plane market as the country seeks to bolster connectivity in far-flung corners and over rugged terrain. The company is expecting India to have as many as 120 small aircraft that seat less than 20 passengers in the next 10 years, Yogesh Garg, the manufacturer’s Asia Pacific sales director, said in an interview in New Delhi on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Airline Economics Growth Frontiers India conference. Small planes are key for India, the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, to connect tiny towns, hilly areas and islands that have a budding population of first-time flyers. Airbus SE estimates India will need 2,210 aircraft by 2040, with most of them being smaller jets. De Havilland will face competition from the 19-seater Dornier 228 aircraft. The Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. made-in-India plane is used by the armed forces, while Alliance Air has one. Another rival is Textron Aviation Inc., with regional carrier IndiaOne Air using its nine-seater Cessna Grand Caravan EX. Better access to regional travel could help revive tourism and air traffic in India after the pandemic gutted travel. The government has allocated 45 billion rupees ($544 million) under a regional connectivity program to develop 100 inadequately served airports, heliports and water aerodromes, in addition to opening 1,000 new routes by next year. It is also giving subsidies to airlines to offer passengers cheaper fares on regional routes. Budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd. is in discussions with De Havilland for five Twin Otter seaplanes, typically found in the Maldives shuttling tourists to resorts. SpiceJet could deploy the seaplanes, carrying 19 passengers, to reach remote parts of the country lacking runways and ground transport like Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Garg said. SpiceJet, De Havilland’s top customer in India, currently operates 32 Dash-8 Q400 turboprop planes, which seat between 78 and 90 people, he said. IndiGo, India’s biggest airline, has a fleet of 78 ATR small planes, a joint venture between Airbus SE and Leonardo SpA of Italy. A spokesperson for SpiceJet didn’t respond to a  request for comment. Regional carriers are also expanding their fleet of small planes. FlyBig has placed an order for 10 Twin Otter aircraft, with the first two potentially being delivered by April, Garg said. Gujarat’s aviation infrastructure agency could add amphibious Twin Otters by the end of this year for routes such as the Sabarmati riverfront to the Rann of Kuchchh, a salt marsh popular among tourists in the western Indian state."
18,2023-03-01 02:18:00,"Singapore fund seeks $125 million for stoves in India, Kenya","The Improved Cook Stoves Carbon Fund will be managed by Singapore’s Impact Capital Asset Management, which has partnered with EKI Energy Services Ltd. ","A Singapore-based money manager plans to raise as much as $125 million to supply energy efficient stoves to families in India and Africa, and will generate returns for investors by selling carbon credits. The Improved Cook Stoves Carbon Fund will be managed by Singapore’s Impact Capital Asset Management, which has partnered with EKI Energy Services Ltd. The Indore, India-based EKI will invest $25 million in the fund and will also make the stoves, according to ICAM Chief Investment officer Deepak Mawandia. “There is a huge opportunity for a meaningful impact in India because if you look at the numbers, it’s mind-boggling,” he said in an interview. “In Africa, the impact on society is much larger, because in some of the areas that we are going and some of the things that we are doing, you see a lot more difference.” The fund is betting the demand for carbon credits, which McKinsey & Co. forecasts may reach $50 billion by 2030, will help it generate returns for investors as polluting companies seek to balance their emissions with offsets generated by CO2-mitigating strategies. The proceeds will help the fund supply 3 million of the cookers in India, as well as Kenya and Ghana within about two years, Mawandia said. The stoves will still burn wood that’s currently being used by families — thereby increasing uptake — but will provide better combustion, allowing households to use 50% less fuel and reduce toxic smoke by as much as 40%, according to ICAM. Each stove helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as five tons per year and the project will generate as much as 3 million carbon credits annually over five years for each $25 million disbursement, the fund said. “In the case of cook stoves, most clean alternatives are more expensive than traditional cookstoves,” said Kyle Harrison, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “But offsets can bridge the gap in costs to allow rapid deployment. We forecast carbon offset supply from clean cookstoves could reach 542 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2050.” Most Vulnerable ICAM will deploy the stoves in phases. During each tranche, as many as 750,000 will be distributed free to people living in rural areas, specifically targeting those who use traditional methods of cooking, typically three-stone stoves which use coal, cowdung and, firewood as fuel. “It’s an energy efficient project with a huge climate impact, and indirectly it has an impact on education, economic welfare, health, hygiene,” Mawandia said. “We believe that a well constructed clean-cooking program is perhaps one of the most impactful projects in the climate change space.” The first beneficiaries will be in India, the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases by volume in 2022. That will be followed by Kenya and Ghana in Africa, the continent that’s most vulnerable to climate change, despite having contributed the least to global warming and having the lowest emissions. While EKI is the fund’s first partner, it’s also seeking to entice family offices in Singapore, as well as hedge funds, and European impact investors, Mawandia said."
