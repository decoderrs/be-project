The latest hybrid plant deploys advanced renewable technologies like bifacial solar PV modules and horizontal single-axis trackers (HSAT) systems to enable maximum electricity generation from solar energy. \r\n\tThe plant is co-located and is designed to deliver CUF of minimum 50 per cent, the highest CUF of any renewable project in India. \r\n\tThe plant harnesses the potential of renewable energy by resolving intermittency of the generation and provides a more reliable solution to meet the rising power demand. \r\n\tThe plant is housed under AGEL's 100 per cent subsidiary Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer Four Limited. \r\n\tEarlier in May 2022, it had operationalised India's first hybrid power plant of 390 MW. This was followed by the commissioning of the world's largest co-located hybrid power plant of 600 MW in September 2022 and the third hybrid power plant of 450 MW in December 2022. All three of these hybrid energy generation assets are located in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.

Prior to this, he had been additional chief secretary to Assam looking after various departments of the state from August 2017 to October 2020. \r\n\tPost-retirement, Barua held the charge of chairperson of Assam Power Distribution Company Ltd. \r\n\tBarua holds M.Phil degree in Defence and Strategic Studies, PG (History) Degree and Graduation (Philosphy) degree. \r\n\tDuring his interaction with the new CERC chairperson, Singh commended the good work done by him during his stint as chairperson of the Assam Power Distribution Company Ltd and said that the power system in the country has improved significantly in recent years. \r\n\tHe added that the current capacity is enough to cater to the electricity demand. \r\n\tHowever, since the economy is growing at close to 7 per cent and the electricity demand at 10 per cent, the power system needs to be ready to cater to this increasing demand for the next decade or so. \r\n\tThe Union minister said that with ease of doing business and transparency, the investments in the power sector has been growing. He, however, said that there was need to keep working towards ensuring a enabling investment climate in the sector. \r\n\tPower Secretary Alok Kumar said that India needs a forward-looking and progressive central regulator with large-scale integration of renewable energy and green hydrogen expected in near future. \r\n\tHe also added that the new chairperson will have a greater responsibility as chairperson of the forum of regulators, where state electricity regulatory commissions are represented, to ensure that power utilities and distribution companies remain financially sound. \r\n\tThe CERC has been established by the government of India under the provisions of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998.

He said the VC model of investment looked like a ponzi scheme. \r\n\t\u201cI would hold venture capitalists responsible who propounded the theory that only the top-line is important and not the bottom-line. I think that is completely wrong. In many ways it looks like a ponzi scheme. Investors say they are in series B, then go to series C, and sell shares to others at a profit, but it is the series Z fellow who is left with a tin box. Hence, I am not a critique of the younger people but of the older people, who have to be open and honest in saying things as it is,\u201d said Murthy. He was speaking at a fireside chat at the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum 2023.\r\n \r\n\tIn conversation with Kunal Bahl, co-founder Snapdeal, Murthy said it is the responsibility of seniors, in the case of start-ups and entrepreneurs, the VC who provide money to them, various advisors, and board of directors to tell the youngsters to \u2018accept deferred gratification\u2019. \r\n\t\u201c\u2026to realise that sacrifice in the short and medium terms will give you much greater return over time. This has been the story of Infosys. We travelled the economy even internationally till we were a $1 billion company,\u201d he added. \r\n\tMurthy\u2019s comment targeting the VCs come at a time when the Indian startups ecosystem is facing a funding winter and has propelled companies to focus on profitability rather than only look at growth. VC who poured funds upwards of $40 billion in 2021, tightened their purse strings resulting in a drop of almost 50 per cent in funding for CY2022. \r\n\tMurthy while talking at the sidelines of the forum also shared that in 2001 when the industry was impacted due to the dotcom bust, Infosys onboarded 1,500 freshers, even as the senior executives and board took salary cuts. \r\n\tWhen asked about the recent delays in onboarding of freshers and in some cases even a salary cut at the fresher level, Murthy said that while he cannot judge others as he does not have access to data, he then shared Infosys example when he was at the helm. \r\n\t\u201cWhat I can say is what we did\u2026 we had given offers to 1,500 freshers and the think tank in the company sat and decided to take the largest salary cut for the internal board of directors, then the next salary cut for the next level, executive VP etc. Then we onboard everyone of the 1,500 fresher. I am glad to say that we are the only company which did it,\u201d he shared. \r\n\tHis comments come at a time when several IT firms have delayed onboarding of freshers, have not visited campuses to hire from the CY23 batch and many have also looked to cut the salary of the fresher candidate. \r\n\tWhen asked if ChatGPT will impact coders, his reply was an emphatic no. \u201cIn 1977-78 there was a thing called Programme generators. Everybody said that youngsters would lose jobs, it didn\u2019t happen\u2026 Human mind is the most flexible and can adapt very well,\u201d he explained. \r\n\tMurthy believes that ChatGTP provides one with a certain knowledge and they can show their creativity and smartness\u2026but cannot replace the human mind.","5":"\r\n\tBeleaguered coding platform WhiteHat Jr has seen an exodus of top HR executives in recent days, including Ashutosh Singh, Director HR Business Partner (HRBP) and HR leader for international markets, reliable sources said on Thursday. \r\n\tSources told IANS that Singh's high-profile departure comes after Gaurav Timble, Director HR, and Nimi Rastogi, Global Head -- Talent Acquisition at WhiteHat Jr have also moved on, as BYJU's is set to soon wind up the coding platform for kids, which it acquired for $300 million, as part of restructuring and cost-cutting measures.\r\n \r\n\tAll the top HR executives at WhiteHat Jr reported to Pravin Prakash, Chief People Officer at BYJU's. \r\n\tPeople close to the development earlier told IANS that the top BYJU's management was in a huddle and meetings were on to appraise the WhiteHat Jr employees about the situation in the next few days. \r\n\tWhiteHat Jr, which at its peak had more than 8,000 employees across the country, now has around 1,300-14,00 employees left at its offices in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. \r\n\tThe discussions at the very top at BYJU's have happened to shut down the WhiteHat Jr brand which has faced severe criticism in the past. \r\n\tBYJU's, however, had said in a statement it has no plans of shutting WhiteHat Jr down. \r\n\t\"We are merely optimising it for organic and efficient growth.
