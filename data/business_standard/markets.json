This is because the index has experienced a sharp sell-off from its recent highs and has now reached a support range of 7,036 - 6,980.\n\r\n\tThe support range is expected to provide a base for the index to recover and initiate a technical bounce, given multiple indicators that suggest a buying range. These indicators include the pivot points, price action, and bollinger bands.\n\r\n\tThe pivot points indicate that the index has reached a critical level of support, which could lead to a reversal in the trend. The price action, meanwhile, shows that the index has been oversold and is due for a rebound. The bollinger bands, on the other hand, indicate that the index is trading near the lower band, which could serve as a strong support level.\n\r\n\tIn light of these indicators, traders and opportunistic investors are advised to hunt for opportunities to buy the index and its constituents within the aforementioned support range of 7,036 - 6,980. This, therefore, would allow them to capitalise on the potential for a technical bounce and take advantage of the buying range.\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, the Nifty Consumption index is currently in a position where a pullback is expected, and the support range of 7,036 - 6,980 is likely to provide a base for a technical bounce. Therefore, traders and investors should look for opportunities to buy within this range. \nNifty Commodities\r\n\tLast close: 5,461.05 \r\n\tAfter experiencing a sharp sell-off on hourly charts, a technical bounce has been seen. However, resistance is expected around 5,475, and once it breaks this level, stiff resistance shall be seen between 5,540 - 5,590. Once the index reaches this range, one could expect a halt of the near-term pullback, and a correction could be expected on charts.\n\r\n\tThe index trend is negative, and a possible target of 5,100 and 4,950 in the short term could be expected. This means that traders and investors should be cautious about entering into long positions as the index could face strong resistance in the near term.\n\r\n\tThe best trading strategy would be to wait for the index to break resistance levels and enter into long positions only after confirming the trend reversal.\n\r\n\tMoreover, traders and investors should keep an eye on global commodity prices, which could have an impact on the Nifty Commodities index. A surge in commodity prices could lead to an increase in the index, whereas a decline in commodity prices could lead to a decrease in the index.\n\r\n\tTherefore, keeping a close watch on global commodity prices and understanding their impact on the index could be helpful in making informed trading decisions.\n\n(Ravi Nathani is an independent technical analyst.

Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, and others underscored their dedication to cutting production costs.

The organizers said they had been the victim of \u201cteleconferencing or Zoom hijacking.\u201d \r\n\tWaller\u2019s speech followed comments by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who told reporters that he still favored raising rates by 25 basis points in March but was open to lifting borrowing costs higher than he had envisioned if the economy remained so robust. \r\n\t\u201cI want to be completely clear: There is a case to be made that we need to go higher,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cJobs have come in stronger than we expected. Inflation is remaining stubborn at elevated levels. Consumer spending is strong. Labor markets remain quite tight.\u201d \r\n\tYields across the Treasury market closed higher Thursday as traders mulled Bostic\u2019s comments, having climbed early in the session on another batch of strong labor-market data. The focus now shifts to a report on the US services sector due Friday. \r\n\tUS central bankers have raised rates rapidly from near zero a year ago to a target range of 4.5% to 4.75%, including a series of four jumbo 0.75 percentage-point increases. In February, they stepped down to a 25 basis-point increase after a half-point move in December. \r\n\tOfficials next meet March 21-22, and by then they will have seen fresh reports on employment and inflation. Recent incoming data has been surprisingly strong: Employers added 517,000 new workers in January while inflation remains well above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. \r\n\tWaller said the payroll report, together with a decline in the unemployment rate in January to 3.4%, showed \u201cthat, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.\u201d \r\n\tFed officials are discussing their evolving outlook, which may include holding the policy rate higher for longer than they expected when they published their last forecast in December. \r\n\tThat outlook showed a full percentage point of cuts by the end of 2024, according to the median projection. Officials will update their quarterly forecasts later this month. \r\n\tFed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance to update lawmakers on the outlook when he heads to Capitol Hill next week to deliver his semi-annual testimony to Congress. He appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.","5":"  \nVodafone Idea (VIL) has started preliminary talks with leading global private equity investors, including Singapore-based Temasek Holdings and US-based KKR, to raise money through equity and debt.","6":"\n \r\n\t\tThe online mutual fund (MF) distribution space is a tricky business. While the potential is huge and the entry barrier is low, generating revenues is a tough task, with dominant players like Groww, Zerodha and Paytm Money offering commission-free plans. However, there is one platform that has managed to successfully crack the revenue-generation model. \r\n\t\tFisdom, which claims to have over 4,70,000 MF investors with the value of their investments exceeding Rs 5,000 crore, sells the regular MF plans as opposed to direct plans, which is offered by most of the platforms. Regular plan distributors get a commission while direct plan sellers do not.\r\n\t \r\n\t\tThe platform owes its success to the reach provided by its bank partners. The company has tied up with 13 small-sized and mid-sized banks, mostly in the public-sector space, to provide investment products to their customers. The money earned through commissions and fees is shared between Fisdom and the banks. \r\n\t\tAccording to the company, over 70 per cent of its business comes through the banking channel. The investments that have come in through these partnerships is over Rs 40,000 crore. \r\n\t\tIn FY22, the startup earned gross commission of Rs 15.5 crore with the average value of MF investments being Rs 1,765 crore (under MF distribution licence), shows industry data. The startup has MF assets under registered investment advisor and stock broking licences as well. \r\n\t\tThe brokerage also offers other investment products like stock broking, alternate investment funds (AIF), portfolio management services (PMS) and tax solutions. \r\n\t\tAnand Dalmia, co-founder and chief business officer, Fisdom, says that the company observed that most of the smaller banks have the capability to sell investment products, given their reach and the investor trust that they enjoyed, but lacked the technology and expertise. The startup decided to harness this opportunity. \r\n\t\t\"Unlike larger banks such as SBI, ICICI and HDFC, most PSU banks and smaller private banks do not have their own manufacturing outfits (asset management companies) and don\u2019t have the expertise to distribute third-party wealth products,\" he said. \r\n\t\tOver the last six years, Fisdom has tied up with banks like Indian Bank, UCO Bank, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Karnataka Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, City Union Bank, Suryoday Bank, and India Post Payments Bank. \r\n\t\tWith tie-ups with Fisdom, banks have been able to offer online investment services to their customers without having to develop their own technology. The service is made possible through the integration of Fisdom's application with that of the banks. \r\n\t\tSoma Sankara Prasad, managing director and CEO, UCO Bank, says that the partnership has proved to be a win-win situation for both the companies. \r\n\t\t\"While the partnership has allowed us to offer wealth management services to our clients, Fisdom has gained access to our customer base. As the revenue is shared, the tie-up has proved beneficial for both of us,\" he said. \n","7":"\r\n\tSolar module makers including Reliance Industries Ltd. and Tata Power Co. are among bidders for Rs 19,500 billion ($2.4 billion) in financial incentives that India is offering to expand domestic manufacturing and curb panel imports from dominant producer China.\n \r\n\tOthers showing interest include U.S. firm First Solar Inc. and Indian companies JSW Energy Ltd., Avaada Group and ReNew Energy Global Plc, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as the information hasn\u2019t been made public. The embattled Adani Group, one of the country\u2019s largest solar panel makers, was not among the bidders, the people said.\r\n \r\n\tThe financial assistance is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s aim to turn the nation into a manufacturing powerhouse, creating more jobs in the economy and reducing imports that can drain foreign exchange. His \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign is an effort to showcase the country as an alternative to China amid a global push to diversify supply chains in the wake of the pandemic. \r\n\tThe government is offering grants to take the country\u2019s module-making capacity to as much as 90 gigawatts, enough to meet its own requirements and serve export markets. \r\n\tStill, the bids come amid concerns that the focus on domestic manufacturing is slowing down renewable power projects, undermining India\u2019s transition targets. Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh said last month that his ministry is considering temporarily \u201crelaxing\u201d a key barrier to module imports to speed up projects. \r\n\tSpokesmen at Reliance, Avaada Group and JSW Energy declined to comment.

As FTX neared collapse, Singh withdrew approximately USD 6 million from FTX for personal use and expenditures, including the purchase of a multi-million dollar house and donations to charitable causes. \r\n\tSingh, a United States citizen, was the Head of Engineering at Alameda and, later, at FTX. Singh resided in Hong Kong and The Bahamas from May 2019 through November 2022. \r\n\tThe SEC complaint said Singh grew up in California and was a childhood friend of Bankman-Fried's brother. In 2017, Bankman-Fried and Wang founded Alameda Research LLC, a crypto asset hedge fund, and Bankman-Fried invited Singh to assist them with engineering projects. \r\n\tAround April 2019, Singh began working with Wang to build FTX, which launched in May of that year. Although he worked primarily as an FTX engineer beginning in the spring of 2019, Singh retained his role and title as Alameda's Head of Engineering and continued to work on Alameda projects. \r\n\tSingh's responsibilities and profile within both Alameda and FTX grew significantly over time, and he ultimately held the role and title of Head of Engineering at both companies. \r\n\tThe SEC's complaint seeks an injunction against future securities law violations and civil penalties among other penalties. \r\n\tSingh has consented to a bifurcated settlement, which is subject to court approval, under which he will be permanently enjoined from violating federal securities laws. SEC said Singh is cooperating with its ongoing investigation. \r\n\tThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission's two-count complaint charges Singh with fraud by misappropriation and with aiding and abetting fraud committed by Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX Trading Ltd and Alameda. \r\n\tSingh was a shareholder and senior executive of FTX and was FTX's Director of Engineering at the time of its collapse in November 2022. \r\n\tThe CFTC complaint charges that Singh personally misappropriated millions of dollars of assets, including FTX customer assets, through poorly documented \"loans\" from Alameda and other improper withdrawals of funds from FTX for various personal expenditures, and did so even after Singh knew or should have known the source of those assets was, at least in part, FTX customer assets. \r\n\tSingh does not contest his liability on the CFTC's claims, and has agreed to the entry of a proposed consent order of judgment as to his liability on the charges in the complaint, CFTC said. \r\n\tSEC Chairman Gary Gensler had said in December last year that Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto. \r\n\tThe alleged fraud committed by Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws, Gensler had said.
