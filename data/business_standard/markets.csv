                                        According to the technical analyst, the Nifty Consumption index is likely to witness a pullback, and the support range of 7,036 - 6,980 is likely to provide a base for a technical bounce                                    ","
Nifty Consumption
	Last close: 7,108.90 
	The bias in the market is for a pullback to occur. This is because the index has experienced a sharp sell-off from its recent highs and has now reached a support range of 7,036 - 6,980.

	The support range is expected to provide a base for the index to recover and initiate a technical bounce, given multiple indicators that suggest a buying range. These indicators include the pivot points, price action, and bollinger bands.

	The pivot points indicate that the index has reached a critical level of support, which could lead to a reversal in the trend. The price action, meanwhile, shows that the index has been oversold and is due for a rebound. The bollinger bands, on the other hand, indicate that the index is trading near the lower band, which could serve as a strong support level.

	In light of these indicators, traders and opportunistic investors are advised to hunt for opportunities to buy the index and its constituents within the aforementioned support range of 7,036 - 6,980. This, therefore, would allow them to capitalise on the potential for a technical bounce and take advantage of the buying range.

	In conclusion, the Nifty Consumption index is currently in a position where a pullback is expected, and the support range of 7,036 - 6,980 is likely to provide a base for a technical bounce. Therefore, traders and investors should look for opportunities to buy within this range. 
Nifty Commodities
	Last close: 5,461.05 
	After experiencing a sharp sell-off on hourly charts, a technical bounce has been seen. However, resistance is expected around 5,475, and once it breaks this level, stiff resistance shall be seen between 5,540 - 5,590. Once the index reaches this range, one could expect a halt of the near-term pullback, and a correction could be expected on charts.

	The index trend is negative, and a possible target of 5,100 and 4,950 in the short term could be expected. This means that traders and investors should be cautious about entering into long positions as the index could face strong resistance in the near term.

	The best trading strategy would be to wait for the index to break resistance levels and enter into long positions only after confirming the trend reversal.

	Moreover, traders and investors should keep an eye on global commodity prices, which could have an impact on the Nifty Commodities index. A surge in commodity prices could lead to an increase in the index, whereas a decline in commodity prices could lead to a decrease in the index.

	Therefore, keeping a close watch on global commodity prices and understanding their impact on the index could be helpful in making informed trading decisions.

Tesla will cut assembly costs by half in future generations of cars, engineers told investors on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Elon Musk did not unveil when it will debut a much-awaited affordable electric vehicle.
 
	Tesla’s much-awaited investor day failed to live up to the hype, and the shares of the electric vehicle maker are paying the price.  
	Share price of the Elon Musk-led company tumbled as much as 8.3 per cent to $186.01 in New York on Thursday, the biggest intraday plunge since January 3. 

	More than a dozen Tesla executives led by Musk discussed everything from a white-paper plan for the globe to embrace sustainable energy to the company’s innovation in managing its operations from manufacturing to service.

	The presentation featured an array of senior engineers, including the new global production chief, Tom Zhu, a nod to Tesla’s attempt to show the depth of its executive bench beyond Musk, the face of the company. 
	But there were no details about when next generation cars would be launched and what models would be offered. 
	Musk had been expected to lay out a plan to make a more-affordable electric vehicle (EV) that would broaden his brand’s appeal and fend off competition. Executives said Tesla’s next generation platform would include more than one vehicle built in standardized factories, but Musk brushed off questions about models in mind. Tesla’s chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, and others underscored their dedication to cutting production costs.

                                        Waller's speech followed comments by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who told reporters that he still favored raising rates by 25 basis points in March but was open to lifting borrowing costs                                    ","
	Two Federal Reserve policymakers cautioned that recent stronger-than-expected readings on the US economy could push them to raise interest rates by more than previously expected. 
 
	In remarks Thursday, Governor Christopher Waller said that if payroll and inflation data cool after hot prints in January, “then I would endorse raising the target range for the federal funds rate a couple more times, to a projected terminal rate between 5.1% and 5.4%.”
 
	“On the other hand, if those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said in remarks prepared for delivery at an event hosted by the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America. 
	His virtual event, including the question and answer session following delivery of his prepared remarks, was canceled after a participant displayed pornographic content that was visible to viewers. The organizers said they had been the victim of “teleconferencing or Zoom hijacking.” 
	Waller’s speech followed comments by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who told reporters that he still favored raising rates by 25 basis points in March but was open to lifting borrowing costs higher than he had envisioned if the economy remained so robust. 
	“I want to be completely clear: There is a case to be made that we need to go higher,” Bostic said. “Jobs have come in stronger than we expected. Inflation is remaining stubborn at elevated levels. Consumer spending is strong. Labor markets remain quite tight.” 
	Yields across the Treasury market closed higher Thursday as traders mulled Bostic’s comments, having climbed early in the session on another batch of strong labor-market data. The focus now shifts to a report on the US services sector due Friday. 
	US central bankers have raised rates rapidly from near zero a year ago to a target range of 4.5% to 4.75%, including a series of four jumbo 0.75 percentage-point increases. In February, they stepped down to a 25 basis-point increase after a half-point move in December. 
	Officials next meet March 21-22, and by then they will have seen fresh reports on employment and inflation. Recent incoming data has been surprisingly strong: Employers added 517,000 new workers in January while inflation remains well above the central bank’s 2% target. 
	Waller said the payroll report, together with a decline in the unemployment rate in January to 3.4%, showed “that, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.” 
	Fed officials are discussing their evolving outlook, which may include holding the policy rate higher for longer than they expected when they published their last forecast in December. 
	That outlook showed a full percentage point of cuts by the end of 2024, according to the median projection. Officials will update their quarterly forecasts later this month. 
	Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance to update lawmakers on the outlook when he heads to Capitol Hill next week to deliver his semi-annual testimony to Congress. He appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday."

                                        Fisdom among few fintechs to generate revenue through MF distribution                                    ","
 
		The online mutual fund (MF) distribution space is a tricky business. While the potential is huge and the entry barrier is low, generating revenues is a tough task, with dominant players like Groww, Zerodha and Paytm Money offering commission-free plans. However, there is one platform that has managed to successfully crack the revenue-generation model. 
		Fisdom, which claims to have over 4,70,000 MF investors with the value of their investments exceeding Rs 5,000 crore, sells the regular MF plans as opposed to direct plans, which is offered by most of the platforms. Regular plan distributors get a commission while direct plan sellers do not.
	 
		The platform owes its success to the reach provided by its bank partners. The company has tied up with 13 small-sized and mid-sized banks, mostly in the public-sector space, to provide investment products to their customers. The money earned through commissions and fees is shared between Fisdom and the banks. 
		According to the company, over 70 per cent of its business comes through the banking channel. The investments that have come in through these partnerships is over Rs 40,000 crore. 
		In FY22, the startup earned gross commission of Rs 15.5 crore with the average value of MF investments being Rs 1,765 crore (under MF distribution licence), shows industry data. The startup has MF assets under registered investment advisor and stock broking licences as well. 
		The brokerage also offers other investment products like stock broking, alternate investment funds (AIF), portfolio management services (PMS) and tax solutions. 
		Anand Dalmia, co-founder and chief business officer, Fisdom, says that the company observed that most of the smaller banks have the capability to sell investment products, given their reach and the investor trust that they enjoyed, but lacked the technology and expertise. The startup decided to harness this opportunity. 
		""Unlike larger banks such as SBI, ICICI and HDFC, most PSU banks and smaller private banks do not have their own manufacturing outfits (asset management companies) and don’t have the expertise to distribute third-party wealth products,"" he said. 
		Over the last six years, Fisdom has tied up with banks like Indian Bank, UCO Bank, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Karnataka Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, City Union Bank, Suryoday Bank, and India Post Payments Bank. 
		With tie-ups with Fisdom, banks have been able to offer online investment services to their customers without having to develop their own technology. The service is made possible through the integration of Fisdom's application with that of the banks. 
		Soma Sankara Prasad, managing director and CEO, UCO Bank, says that the partnership has proved to be a win-win situation for both the companies. 
		""While the partnership has allowed us to offer wealth management services to our clients, Fisdom has gained access to our customer base. As the revenue is shared, the tie-up has proved beneficial for both of us,"" he said.

	Solar module makers including Reliance Industries Ltd. and Tata Power Co. are among bidders for Rs 19,500 billion ($2.4 billion) in financial incentives that India is offering to expand domestic manufacturing and curb panel imports from dominant producer China.
 
	Others showing interest include U.S. firm First Solar Inc. and Indian companies JSW Energy Ltd., Avaada Group and ReNew Energy Global Plc, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as the information hasn’t been made public. The embattled Adani Group, one of the country’s largest solar panel makers, was not among the bidders, the people said.
 
	The financial assistance is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aim to turn the nation into a manufacturing powerhouse, creating more jobs in the economy and reducing imports that can drain foreign exchange. His “Make in India” campaign is an effort to showcase the country as an alternative to China amid a global push to diversify supply chains in the wake of the pandemic. 
	The government is offering grants to take the country’s module-making capacity to as much as 90 gigawatts, enough to meet its own requirements and serve export markets. 
	Still, the bids come amid concerns that the focus on domestic manufacturing is slowing down renewable power projects, undermining India’s transition targets. Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh said last month that his ministry is considering temporarily “relaxing” a key barrier to module imports to speed up projects. 
	Spokesmen at Reliance, Avaada Group and JSW Energy declined to comment. The renewables ministry, as well as Adani, Tata Power, ReNew and First Solar, didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
	The bids, being conducted by state-run Solar Energy Corp., closed Feb. 28, after being extended multiple times. Details on incentives and projects aren’t yet available. "

	Nishad Singh, a 27-year-old Indian-origin former top executive of failed cryptocurrency trading platform FTX has pleaded guilty to the charges of alleged billion-dollar fraud at the now collapsed exchange. 
	Singh was the former co-lead engineer of FTX Trading Ltd.
 
	He has pleaded guilty to six conspiracy charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate federal campaign finances laws. 
	Singh is the third top executive and close confidante of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors. 
	Gary Wang, co-founder of FTX, and Caroline Ellison, the former head of FTX's sister hedge fund Alameda Research, both pleaded guilty last year and are cooperating against Bankman-Fried. 
	In December last year, federal authorities charged Bankman-Fried with orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX. 
	The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Singh on Tuesday. 
	In a parallel action, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against Singh. 
	Singh entered a guilty plea to commodities fraud and other charges in the separate, parallel action against him in the Southern District of New York. 
	According to the SEC's complaint, Singh created a software code that allowed FTX customer funds to be diverted to Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund owned by Bankman-Fried and Wang, despite false assurances by Bankman-Fried to investors that FTX was a safe crypto asset trading platform with sophisticated risk mitigation measures to protect customer assets and that Alameda was just another customer with no special privileges. 
	The complaint alleges that Singh knew or should have known that such statements were false and misleading. 
	The complaint also alleges that Singh was an active participant in the scheme to deceive FTX's investors. As FTX neared collapse, Singh withdrew approximately USD 6 million from FTX for personal use and expenditures, including the purchase of a multi-million dollar house and donations to charitable causes. 
	Singh, a United States citizen, was the Head of Engineering at Alameda and, later, at FTX. Singh resided in Hong Kong and The Bahamas from May 2019 through November 2022. 
	The SEC complaint said Singh grew up in California and was a childhood friend of Bankman-Fried's brother. In 2017, Bankman-Fried and Wang founded Alameda Research LLC, a crypto asset hedge fund, and Bankman-Fried invited Singh to assist them with engineering projects. 
	Around April 2019, Singh began working with Wang to build FTX, which launched in May of that year. Although he worked primarily as an FTX engineer beginning in the spring of 2019, Singh retained his role and title as Alameda's Head of Engineering and continued to work on Alameda projects. 
	Singh's responsibilities and profile within both Alameda and FTX grew significantly over time, and he ultimately held the role and title of Head of Engineering at both companies. 
	The SEC's complaint seeks an injunction against future securities law violations and civil penalties among other penalties. 
	Singh has consented to a bifurcated settlement, which is subject to court approval, under which he will be permanently enjoined from violating federal securities laws. SEC said Singh is cooperating with its ongoing investigation. 
	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's two-count complaint charges Singh with fraud by misappropriation and with aiding and abetting fraud committed by Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX Trading Ltd and Alameda. 
	Singh was a shareholder and senior executive of FTX and was FTX's Director of Engineering at the time of its collapse in November 2022. 
	The CFTC complaint charges that Singh personally misappropriated millions of dollars of assets, including FTX customer assets, through poorly documented ""loans"" from Alameda and other improper withdrawals of funds from FTX for various personal expenditures, and did so even after Singh knew or should have known the source of those assets was, at least in part, FTX customer assets. 
	Singh does not contest his liability on the CFTC's claims, and has agreed to the entry of a proposed consent order of judgment as to his liability on the charges in the complaint, CFTC said. 
	SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had said in December last year that Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto. 
	The alleged fraud committed by Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws, Gensler had said.
