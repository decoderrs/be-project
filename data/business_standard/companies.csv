Adani Green Energy on Thursday said its 700-MW hybrid green energy project has become operational, which took its total operating renewable portfolio to 8,024 MW, the largest in India. 
	The project is its fourth wind-solar hybrid power plant fully operational at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, a company statement said.
 
	It stated that the 700-MW plant is the world's largest wind-solar hybrid power plant. 
	""With the successful operationalisation of the 700-MW plant, the world's largest wind-solar hybrid power plant, AGEL now has the largest operating renewable portfolio in India with 8,024 MW,"" it said. 
	The combined operational generation capacity of this newly added hybrid power plant is 700 MW and has a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) at Rs 3.24/kwh for 25 years. 
	This new hybrid power plant consists of a combination of 600 MW solar and 510 MW wind plants. The latest hybrid plant deploys advanced renewable technologies like bifacial solar PV modules and horizontal single-axis trackers (HSAT) systems to enable maximum electricity generation from solar energy. 
	The plant is co-located and is designed to deliver CUF of minimum 50 per cent, the highest CUF of any renewable project in India. 
	The plant harnesses the potential of renewable energy by resolving intermittency of the generation and provides a more reliable solution to meet the rising power demand. 
	The plant is housed under AGEL's 100 per cent subsidiary Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer Four Limited. 
	Earlier in May 2022, it had operationalised India's first hybrid power plant of 390 MW. This was followed by the commissioning of the world's largest co-located hybrid power plant of 600 MW in September 2022 and the third hybrid power plant of 450 MW in December 2022. All three of these hybrid energy generation assets are located in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.

	""Union Minister for Power R K Singh administered the oath of office and secrecy to Jishnu Barua, chairperson, Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), here today,"" a power ministry statement said.
 
	Barua has been appointed chairperson of the CERC on February 27, 2023. 
	Barua was chief secretary of Assam from October 2020 to August 2022. Prior to this, he had been additional chief secretary to Assam looking after various departments of the state from August 2017 to October 2020.

	During his interaction with the new CERC chairperson, Singh commended the good work done by him during his stint as chairperson of the Assam Power Distribution Company Ltd and said that the power system in the country has improved significantly in recent years. 
	He added that the current capacity is enough to cater to the electricity demand. 
	However, since the economy is growing at close to 7 per cent and the electricity demand at 10 per cent, the power system needs to be ready to cater to this increasing demand for the next decade or so. 
	The Union minister said that with ease of doing business and transparency, the investments in the power sector has been growing. He, however, said that there was need to keep working towards ensuring a enabling investment climate in the sector. 
	Power Secretary Alok Kumar said that India needs a forward-looking and progressive central regulator with large-scale integration of renewable energy and green hydrogen expected in near future. 
	He also added that the new chairperson will have a greater responsibility as chairperson of the forum of regulators, where state electricity regulatory commissions are represented, to ensure that power utilities and distribution companies remain financially sound. 
	The CERC has been established by the government of India under the provisions of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998. CERC is the central commission for the purposes of the Electricity Act, 2003 which has repealed the ERC Act, 1998. 
	The commission consists of a chairperson and four other members, including Chairperson, Central Electricity Authority, who is the ex-officio member of the commission. 
	Major functions of CERC under the Act are, inter-alia, to regulate the tariff of generating companies owned or controlled by the central government, to regulate the tariff of other generating companies having a composite scheme for generation and sale of electricity in more than one state, to regulate the inter-state transmission of electricity and to determine tariff for such transmission of electricity, etc.

	The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Gujarat on Thursday told the state Assembly there was no tendering process to award a contract for the 'Adani Skill Development, Ahmedabad' facility meant to impart training to Scheduled Caste youths. 
	Responding to query from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Hemant Ahir during Question Hour, state Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Bhanuben Babariya said the Director of Scheduled Caste Welfare had signed a contract with the entity to train SC youths in March 2019 and issued a work order in August 2019.
 
	As per the contract, the state government would pay Rs 13.98 crore to Adani Skill Development to train these youths, of which Rs 7.87 lakh had been paid in the last two years, as per the minister's written reply. 
	In reply to a sub-question on whether a tender process was followed, Babariya replied in the negative, adding further not a single SC youth was imparted training in 2021 and 2022 by the entity.

                                        Murthy believes that ChatGTP provides one with a certain knowledge and they can show their creativity and smartness…but cannot replace the human mind                                    ","
	N R Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, blamed the venture capitalist community for inculcating a culture among entrepreneurs to chase growth at all costs. He said the VC model of investment looked like a ponzi scheme. 
	“I would hold venture capitalists responsible who propounded the theory that only the top-line is important and not the bottom-line. I think that is completely wrong. In many ways it looks like a ponzi scheme. Investors say they are in series B, then go to series C, and sell shares to others at a profit, but it is the series Z fellow who is left with a tin box. Hence, I am not a critique of the younger people but of the older people, who have to be open and honest in saying things as it is,” said Murthy. He was speaking at a fireside chat at the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum 2023.
 
	In conversation with Kunal Bahl, co-founder Snapdeal, Murthy said it is the responsibility of seniors, in the case of start-ups and entrepreneurs, the VC who provide money to them, various advisors, and board of directors to tell the youngsters to ‘accept deferred gratification’. 
	“…to realise that sacrifice in the short and medium terms will give you much greater return over time. This has been the story of Infosys. We travelled the economy even internationally till we were a $1 billion company,” he added. 
	Murthy’s comment targeting the VCs come at a time when the Indian startups ecosystem is facing a funding winter and has propelled companies to focus on profitability rather than only look at growth. VC who poured funds upwards of $40 billion in 2021, tightened their purse strings resulting in a drop of almost 50 per cent in funding for CY2022. 
	Murthy while talking at the sidelines of the forum also shared that in 2001 when the industry was impacted due to the dotcom bust, Infosys onboarded 1,500 freshers, even as the senior executives and board took salary cuts. 
	When asked about the recent delays in onboarding of freshers and in some cases even a salary cut at the fresher level, Murthy said that while he cannot judge others as he does not have access to data, he then shared Infosys example when he was at the helm. 
	“What I can say is what we did… we had given offers to 1,500 freshers and the think tank in the company sat and decided to take the largest salary cut for the internal board of directors, then the next salary cut for the next level, executive VP etc. Then we onboard everyone of the 1,500 fresher. I am glad to say that we are the only company which did it,” he shared. 
	His comments come at a time when several IT firms have delayed onboarding of freshers, have not visited campuses to hire from the CY23 batch and many have also looked to cut the salary of the fresher candidate. 
	When asked if ChatGPT will impact coders, his reply was an emphatic no. “In 1977-78 there was a thing called Programme generators. Everybody said that youngsters would lose jobs, it didn’t happen… Human mind is the most flexible and can adapt very well,” he explained. 
	Murthy believes that ChatGTP provides one with a certain knowledge and they can show their creativity and smartness…but cannot replace the human mind."

	The company said that it is constantly evaluating and optimising its business operations towards global growth. 
	""As an ongoing activity, we are actively evaluating all our business units to ensure that they are aligned with our path to profitability,"" BYJU's said. 
	BYJU's acquired WhiteHat Jr in July 2020 for nearly $300 million. It reported a massive Rs 1,690 crore loss in the financial year 2021, while its expenses reached Rs 2,175 crore in FY21 -- compared to Rs 69.7 crore in FY20. 
	In the April-May period last year, over 1,000 of its employees, including teachers which are on contractual basis, and hence not full-time employees, resigned. Later, more WhiteHat Jr employees either moved on their own or were asked to go. 
	WhiteHat Jr shut its schools division that targeted to take its flagship coding curriculum to 10 lakh school students by the next academic year.
